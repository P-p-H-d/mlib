*Long term issues*
------------------

* TODO #28 : Separate generation of interface to implementation :ENHANCEMENT:

Enable support for generating an interface only for the headers
and an implementation only for the source code.

Try to keep API compatibility
==> Only modify renamed macro with M_ prefix by giving a new mandatory
argument for such generation.

This argument is a generation parametric argument.
oplist is a parameter that define the property of the contained type.
It could be used to pass this information but it will be an abuse of interface.
Another argument is needed.

Used arguments to parameter generation not related to the contained type:

- memory interface (NEW / DEL / ...)
- queue policy
- fixed size for queue
- generate static inline, public (extern) or private (define) functions.
- name of the type.
- name of the iterator
- name of the iterated element.
- ...

Use another oplist as argument for M_.._DEF_AS?

 M_BUFFER_DEF_AS(name, (TYPE(toto), FIXED_SIZE(10), POLICY(STACK), INTERFACE(header)), int, M_BASIC_OPLIST)

* TODO #27 : Uniformization of m-buffer interface               :ENHANCEMENT:

The m-buffer interface requires special argument to work:
- size & policy for BUFFER,
- policy only for the others.
This is not uniform with the others generation macros and not uniform with each other.
Moreover the others are the only one which can be used in a shared memory, so
a fixed size will be good to have too for such interface.

==> Uniformize the interface. How?
==> Provide static size for all QUEUE.

* TODO #26 : Hash-Map for huge objects                          :ENHANCEMENT:

Specialize Hashmap for huge objects on supported hardware:

Based on OA hash map with taggued pointer (needs space for tagging):
low bits = high bits of hash
pointer to object { key, hash, value }

Can solve collision without dereferencing object with 1/2^lowbits chances.
NB: hash may be uneeded due to the small chances of collision.
Reduce cache usage ==> Should be faster.
Increase cache usage for very small object (integer).

Use of pointer to avoid moving object on GC.

On AMD64, only 48 bits of 64 bits are really used for addressing data.
==> lowbits= 16
Empty representation= 0 (hash can be 0. pointer cannot be it).
Deleted representation = 1 (pointer cannot be zero)

<---- PTR ----><-HASH->

#+BEGIN_SRC C
#define LOW_BITS 16
#define ALIGNED_BITS 2
void *get_ptr(int64_t x) { 
  return (void*) ((x >> LOW_BITS) << ALIGNED_BITS);
}         
unsigned get_small_hash(int64_t x) {
  return x & ((1<<LOW_BITS)-1);
}
#+END_SRC

* TODO #25 : Support of error return model for error handling.  :ENHANCEMENT:

Find a way to support error return code for the API in case of allocation
failure.

Any service that returns void shall return a "int".
In case of allocation failure, it shall return an error.
M_CALL macro shall stop its execution if the service returns an error code
and the error code represents an error (avoid rewritting everything)
and throw back the error code (stopping the execution flow).

Services returning already something shall not be modified.

This model should be applied at the container level only and not globally.
Different containers may need different levels of error handling.
4 combinaison to take into account:

==> ABORT on container / ABORT on used type: The current model
==> ABORT on container / RETCODE on used type: Needs to abort on reported error.
==> RETCODE on container / ABORT on used type: Nothing particular to note.
==> RETCODE on container / RETCODE on used type: Forward retcode to caller.

Find a way to make it while not making the code too complex 
(try to keep as simple as possible).

Using a specialized oplist for such containers (_OPLIST_RETCODE)
using a specialized API for retcode:

API_RET_*: that expands to

     if (func(args) == 0) goto handler_exit_failure;

Adding at the end of each service:
     M_END_FUNCTION(cleanup_code) that expands to different cases:
     M_END_FUNCTION_VALUE(cleanup_code, return_success, return_failure) that expands to different cases:

ABORT/ABORT:
     handler_exit_success: 
     handler_exit_failure: 
      return;

ABORT/RETCODE:
     handler_exit_success: 
      return;
     handler_exit_failure: 
      RAISE_FATAL_ERROR

RETCODE/ABORT
     handler_exit_success: 
      return SUCESS;
     handler_exit_failure: 
      cleanup_code
      return FAILURE;

RETCODE/RETCODE
     handler_exit_success: 
      return SUCESS;
     handler_exit_failure: 
      cleanup_code
      return FAILURE;

If really needed, the macro can be avoided and code can be hand written.

Open points:
- How to handle warnings on unused labels?
- What about M_LET/ M_EACH?


* TODO #24 : New: Add MIN-MAX-HEAP container                    :ENHANCEMENT:

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min-max_heap
as DPRIORITY_QUEUE_DEF ?

NOTE: Needs for such container?


* TODO #23: Strict MOVE semantic to clarify                     :ENHANCEMENT:

Some type may need to have a force MOVE semantic (for example, they can store
pointer to themselves). Currently the INIT_MOVE & MOVE operators are more
a help for performance than a strict semantic usage.

** ARRAY container

The ARRAY container doesn't support strict MOVE semantic for example.
It is not a simple matter as it performs a realloc of the table, thus
moving the data before they can be moved using MOVE. Two solutions:

- New operator MOVE_SELF to fix a type after it has been moved.
- If MOVE defined, force another table and then copy by hand the type. This will be slower and consumme more memory.

** MOVE in OPLIST                                               :ENHANCEMENT:

Proposal: do not export INIT_MOVE / MOVE operator in OPLIST if the MOVE operator is 
compatible with a pure COPY semantic. An exported MOVE operator will tell 
other containers than the type shall be carefully moved using the provided
MOVE operator.

For example for tuple, it shall

- create an init_move operator if no one has disabled INIT_MOVE,
- export the init_move operator if at least one has exported a INIT_MOVE and no one has disabled INIT_MOVE.

** DO_INIT_MOVE operator

DO_INIT_MOVE macro is not also fully working for structure
defined with [1] tricks but without an explicit INIT_MOVE / MOVE
operators as it uses MOVE_DEFAULT which is not (fully compatible).
==> Analyse limitation and possible constraint usages.


Being able to define a correct default for INIT_MOVE will be really good
(compatible with trivial move copy).
In such case, all INIT_MOVE & MOVE operators can be removed from oplist
to only use the default, and theses operators can be disabled or defined
only when really needed in the oplist.
However creating a default INIT_MOVE macro seems problematic.
If the type is typedef T t[1] then passing such an argument to a function, 
will transform the argument to T*, and the type of the argument doesn't match
what is expecting resulting in a move of the pointers, not a move of the design data.

Defining a TYPE to this macro seems mandatory, but without C11 _Generic
I don't see any way to define such macro.


* TODO #20: New: Bucket priority queue                          :ENHANCEMENT:

Add a new kind of priority queue. 
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_queue

Check if it will be better as intrusive or non-intrusive container.

To test if a bucket is empty or not, a bitfield can be used to check if
the bit associated to the bucket is set or not. To get the highest bucket
non empty, we can perform a CLZ of the bitset, which shall be much faster than
performing a linear search of the buckets (algorithm complexity is the same,
except that we can scan 64 entries at a time).

Check if we can use BITSET, or introduce fixed size BITSET or use ad-hock 
implementation.


* TODO #19: New: Intrusive Red Black Tree                       :ENHANCEMENT:

 Add intrusive red black tree. 
 Look also for AVL tree (NOTE: Is there a performance difference between the two?)


* TODO #18: Missing methods                                     :ENHANCEMENT:

Some containers don't have all the methods they should.
See the cells in yellow here:
http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/P-p-H-d/mlib/blob/master/doc/Container.html


* TODO #17: New: Ressource handler                              :ENHANCEMENT:

 A global 'ressouce handler' which shall associated a unique handle to a ressource.
 The handle shall be unique for the ressource and shall not be reused.
 It is typically a 64 bits integers always incremented (even if the program
 creates one billion ressources per second, the counter won't overflow
 until 585 years).

 The ressource handler shall make an association between a HANDLE 64 bits and:

- how much real owners claim to own the ressource
 (the ressource is only owned by the ressource handler, however
  it acts as a delegate of the real owner),
- how much users keep a pointer to the ressource.
- pointer to the resource itself.

 This may be a better alternative than shared_ptr & weak_ptr:

- reduce fragmentation,
- no cycle dependencies,
- shared_ref & weak_ref becomes only HANDLE,
- all ressources can be freed in one pass.
 
 Needs lock free dictionnary or at least concurrent dictionnary.

 How to handle multiple resource ? 

 * variant: works fine. Memory usage can be (much) higher than needed if there is a lot of dissimilarity between the size of the objects.
 * embedded the type in the ressource handler: more work, API more complex. Memory usage seems better.


* TODO #16: New: Lock Free List                                 :ENHANCEMENT:

 Implement a lock free list. Most of the difficulty is the memory reclamation part.
 Typically this lock free list shall be compatible with RCU method.

** First  step: backoff methods                                        :DONE:
** Second step: lock free node pool :                                  :DONE:
   Done as m-c-mempool header.

** Third  step: Implement generic lock free list on top of it.

 The ABA problem is already taken into account by the memory alloctor
 provided that the lock free list doesn't try to be smart.

 backoff has be used when using CAS.
 
 Concurrent insertion / insertion and insertion / deletion and deletion / deletion shall be crefully analyzed when taken into account.
 
 Questions:
 - singly or doubly or dual push?
 - needs to be logically deleted : needs a previous field
   (NULL if not logically deleted) ? TBC


* TODO #14: Memory allocation enhancement                       :ENHANCEMENT:

Enhancement of the memory allocation scheme to find way to deal properly with advanced allocators:

-  non-default alignment requirements for types,
-  instance-based allocator (may need instance based variable access),
-  expected life of created type (temporary or permanent),
-  stack based allocator,
-  global variable access for allocator,
-  maximum allocation before failure.

Most of theses are already more or less supported. Examples shall be created to show how to deal with this:

- alignement shall be implemented with the attributes of <stdalign.h>

However I sill don't know how to implement "instance-based allocator" which is what is missing.
The problem is how to give to methods context local information store within the container itself.

Update:

API transformation support enables "instance-based allocator" to be made easily.
Needs some formal operator in the oplist to support it fully and an example.

 Can be supported using another API extension, some more operators and forcing some names:

 * API_N: call like FUNC(obj->extra_data, type)

 'obj' is a forced named corresponding to an alias to an object in the function.
 Operator needed:
  
 - EXTRA_DATA: Add an extra-data field wihtin the container. Defines the type of data.

It is a kind of object  inheritance where the container inherits some extra data from its base.


* TODO #12: New: Atomic shared pointer                          :ENHANCEMENT:

Add an extension to the SHARED_PTR API:

- New type atomic_shared_ptr
- name_init_atomic_set (&atomic_shared_ptr, shared_ptr);
- name_init_set_atomic (shared_ptr, &atomic_shared_ptr);
- name_init_atomic_set_atomic (&atomic_shared_ptr, &atomic_shared_ptr);
- name_atomic_set (&atomic_shared_ptr, shared_ptr);
- name_set_atomic (shared_ptr, &atomic_shared_ptr);
- name_atomic_set_atomic (&atomic_shared_ptr, &atomic_shared_ptr);
- name_atomic_clear

No _ref or direct _init: we need to init first a normal shared_ptr then the atomic (TBC)

** _atomic_set method:

It can be implemented by incrementing the non atomic shared pointer reference, 
then performs a compare_and_swap to the data of the atomic shared pointer, 
finally decrement and dec/free the swapped previous data of the atomic like a normal shared pointer.
All 3 steps are safe.

** _set_atomic method:

It needs to perform the following atomic operation : <read the pointer, deref pointer and increment the pointed value> I don't known how to do it properly.

See http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4162.pdf

Proposition for _set_atomic we store temporary NULL to the atomic_ptr struct to request an exclusive access to the data (this looks like a lock and other operations need to handle NULL) :

#+BEGIN_SRC C
        void shared_ptr_set_atomic(ptr a, atomic_ptr *ptr)
        {
          // Get exclusive access to the data
          p = atomic_load(ptr);
          do {
            if (p == NULL) {
              // TODO: exponential backoff
              p = atomic_load(ptr);
              continue;
            }
          } while (!atomic_compare_exchange_weak(ptr, &p, NULL));
          // p has exclusive access to the pointer
          p->data->cpt ++;
          a->data = p->data;
          atomic_exchange (ptr, p);
        }
#+END_SRC

This prevents using NULL which obliges atomic shared pointer to point to a created object...

Other alternative solution is to use the bit 0 to mark the pointer as being updated, preventing other from using it (TBC only clear):

#+BEGIN_SRC C
        void shared_ptr_set_atomic(ptr a, atomic_ptr *ptr)
        {
          // Get exclusive access to the data
          p = atomic_load(ptr);
          do {
            if ( (p&1) != 0) {
              // TODO: exponential backoff
              p = atomic_load(ptr);
              continue;
            }
          } while (!atomic_compare_exchange_weak(ptr, &p, p|1));
         // Exclusive access (kind of lock).
          p->data->cpt ++;
          a->data = p->data;
          atomic_set (ptr, p);
        }
#+END_SRC

Other implementation seems to have it hard to be lock-free: cf. https://github.com/llvm-mirror/libcxx/commit/5fec82dc0db3623546038e4a86baa44f749e554f



* TODO #5: New: Concurrent dictionary Container                 :ENHANCEMENT:

Implement a more efficient dictionary than lock + std dictionary for all operations when dealing with threads.
See https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd287191(v=vs.110).aspx

The best parallel algorithm is still when there is as few synchronization as possible. A concurrent dictionary will fail at this and will result in average performance at best.
The typical best case will be in RCU context (a lot of readers, few writers), so the interface shall be compatible with such structure.

** Multiple locks within the dictionnary

A potential implementation may be to request at initialization time the number of concurrent thread N.
Create a static array of N dictionnary with N mutex. Then to access the data will perform :

- compute hash of object,
- access high bits of hash and select which dictionnary shall have the data,
- lock it,
- perform classic access to the data (check if the compiler can properly optimize the hash computation),
- unlock it.

The property of the hash shall allow a good dispersion of the data across multiple locks, reducing the constraints on the lock. This implementation could be build easily upon the already existent dictionary.

To test.

See also https://github.com/simonhf/sharedhashfile

** Lock Free dictionnary 

Evaluate also lock-free dictionary (easier with open addressing). 
It needs a complete rewrite of the inner loop through. The hard part is the dynamic resizing of the internal array.
Ssee http://preshing.com/20160222/a-resizable-concurrent-map/ for a potential solution
 and http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tomhart/papers/tomhart_thesis.pdf for memory reclamation techniques). 
 and https://www.research.ibm.com/people/m/michael/spaa-2002.pdf
https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/paulmck/perfbook/perfbook.2017.11.22a.pdf presents different techniques used by linux kernel.
It needs before lock-free list: http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~ruppert/papers/lfll.pdf http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~ruppert/Mikhail.pdf

 A good way maybe Open Addessing table used only for indirection and a freelist memory reclamation container for handle the entries
 (like a transaction).

 Solution?
 --------
 
 Use of the concurrent pool (m-c-mempool) to allocate items.
 The big table will only store pointers (+ part of hash in unused bits?) to such allocate items.
 Atomic update is done by allocating a new node, update it, and atomicaly store it in the dict, putting the old one as logically deleted and to reclaim later.
 (Other threads may still read its data so we cannot free immediatly). 
 

* DONE #22: Enhanced services for SPSC Queue                    :ENHANCEMENT:

Add services:

** DONE _push_bulk
Test the capacity of the queue and push as much as possible in the queue
with one check of the atomic structure.

** DONE _pop_bulk
Test the capacity of the queue and push as much as possible in the queue
with one check of the atomic structure.

** DONE _push_force:

If the capacity of the queue is full, pop one element and push it:
push always succeed and the queue always keep the youngest element.

* DONE #21: Generic Binary serialization                        :ENHANCEMENT:

   Based on issue #26 of  https://github.com/P-p-H-d/mlib/issues/26
   
   Some kind of "binary serialization" on the model of get_str/parse_str 
   could be possible. It would be a great feature from the application 
   point-of-view: binary representation is more bandwidth-efficient if 
   used on network communications.

   It will be good to have import/export methods to the 
   XML/JSON/MSGPACK/PROTOBUF/BINARY format. 
   However, adding all of them on by one in the M*LIB containers
   doesn't seem satisfactory. 

   Instead, adding a generic interface for the serialization of data 
   that may be customized by the user to perform the import/export of
   objects in whatever format they want into what they want (FILE/memory/...). 
   To simplify it, this interface could only support one kind of import/export
   per compilation unit.

* DONE #15: Prologue / Epilogue for Constructor / Destructor for error handling :ENHANCEMENT:
  
Constructor (and destructor) need to use user-defined prologue / epilogue.
This is in order to register the constructed object into a proper Exception
Handling Stack so that throwing exceptions may work reliably.

Proposal:

- M_CONSTRUCTOR_PROLOGUE(object, oplist);
- M_CONSTRUCTOR_EPILOGUE(object, oplist);
- M_DESTRUCTOR_PROLOGUE(object, oplist);
- M_DESTRUCTOR_EPILOGUE(object, oplist);

Object creation will need to add all sub-objects into the stack, 
then unstack all to push instead the root object (which recursively remove them).

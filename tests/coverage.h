/* Coverage helper header.
   Computing coverage for a generic macro expansing library is not trivial
   as there is no tool to do it normally.

   That's why a special way has been designed:
   *) Put the code to coverage within the macros START_COVERAGE & END_COVERAGE
   (without forgetting to include the header coverage.h before)
   #include "coverage.h"
   START_COVERAGE
   [code to be expanded & to be coveraged]
   END_COVERAGE

   Run the coverage in the makefile like this:
   *) make coverage-test/test-marray.c
   
   View the coverage file test-marray.c.gcov
   It'll contain the macro expanded & annotated.

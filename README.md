M\*LIB: a Generic type-safe Container Library in C language
==========================================================

Overview
--------

M\*LIB (M star lib) is a C library enabling to use **generic and
type safe container** in pure C language, aka handling generic
[containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_%28abstract_data_type%29).
The objects within the containers can still have proper constructor, destructor
(and other methods):
this is handled by the library. This makes it possible to construct fully
recursive objects (container-of[...]-container-of-type-T),
without erasing type information (typically using void pointers or resorting
to C macro to access the container).

This is an equivalent of the [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
[STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library) but for standard ISO C99.
There is not a strict mapping as both the STL and M\*LIB have their exclusive containers:
See [here](https://github.com/P-p-H-d/mlib/wiki/STL-to-M*LIB-mapping) for details.

M\*LIB is portable to any systems that support [ISO C99](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99).
Some optional features need at least [ISO C11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_(C_standard_revision)).

M\*LIB is **only** composed of a set of headers.
There is no C file: you just have to put the header in the search path of your compiler,
and it will work.
There is no dependency (except some other headers of M\*LIB and the LIBC).

One of M\*LIB's design key is to ensure safety. This is done by multiple means:

* in debug mode, defensive programming is extensively used:
the contracts of the function are checked, ensuring
that the data are not corrupted. For example, 
[Buffer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow) are checked in this mode
through [bound checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounds_checking)
or the intrinsic properties of a Red-Black tree are verified.
* very few casts are used within the library. Still the library can be used
with the greatest level of warnings by a C compiler without
any aliasing warning.
* the genericity is not done directly by macro, but indirectly by making them
define inline functions with the proper prototypes: this enables
the user calls to have proper warning checks.

Other key designs are:

* do not rewrite the C library and just wrap around it (for example don't rewrite sort but stable sort),
* do not make users pay the cost of what they don't need.

Due to the [weak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing#Pointers)  nature of the C language for pointers,
[type safe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_safety)
means that at least a warning
is generated by the compiler in case of wrong type passed as
container arguments to the functions.

M\*LIB is still be quite-efficient: even if the implementation may not always be state
of the art, there is no overhead in using this library rather than using
direct C low-level access: the compiler is able to **fully** optimize
the library calls
since all the functions are declared as inline.
In [fact](https://github.com/P-p-H-d/mlib/wiki/performance), M\*LIB
is one of the fastest generic C library you can find.

M\*LIB uses internally the 'malloc', 'realloc' and 'free' functions to handle
the memory pool. This behavior can be overridden at different level.
M\*LIB default policy is to abort the 
program if there is a memory error. However, this behavior
can also be customized.

M\*LIB may use a lot of assertions in its implementation to ensure safety: 
it is highly recommended to properly define NDEBUG for released programs. 

M\*LIB is distributed under BSD-2 simplified license.

It is strongly advised not to read the source to know how to use the library
but rather read the examples or the tests.

Components
----------

The available containers that doesn't require the user structure to be modified are:

* [m-array.h](#m-array): header for creating array of generic type and of variable size,
* [m-list.h](#m-list): header for creating singly-linked list of generic type,
* [m-deque.h](#m-deque): header for creating double-ended queue of generic type and of variable size,
* [m-dict.h](#m-dict): header for creating generic dictionary or set of generic types,
* [m-rbtree.h](#m-rbtree): header for creating binary sorted tree,
* [m-bptree.h](#m-bptree): header for creating B+TREE of generic type,
* [m-tuple.h](#m-tuple): header for creating arbitrary tuple of generic type,
* [m-variant.h](#m-variant): header for creating arbitrary variant of generic type,
* [m-prioqueue.h](#m-prioqueue): header for creating priority queue of generic type and of variable size,

The available containers of M\*LIB for thread synchronization are:

* [m-buffer.h](#m-buffer): header for creating fixed-size queue (or stack) of generic type (multiple producer / multiple consumer),
* [m-snapshot](#m-snapshot): header for creating 'snapshot' buffer for sharing synchronously data (thread safe).
* [m-shared.h](#m-shared): header for creating shared pointer of generic type.
* [m-concurrent.h](#m-concurrent): header for transforming a container into a concurrent container.

The following containers are intrusive (You need to modify your structure to add fields needed by the container):

* [m-i-list.h](#m-i-list): header for creating doubly-linked intrusive list of generic type,
* [m-i-shared.h](#m-i-shared): header for creating intrusive shared pointer of generic type (Thread Safe),


Other headers offering other functionality are:

* [m-bitset.h](#m-bitset): header for creating bit set (or "packed array of bool"),
* [m-string.h](#m-string): header for creating dynamic variable-length string,
* [m-algo.h](#m-algo): header for providing various generic algorithms to the previous containers.
* [m-mempool.h](#m-mempool): header for creating specialized & fast memory allocator.
* [m-worker.h](#m-worker): header for providing an easy pool of workers to handle work orders, used for parallelism tasks.
* [m-serial-json.h](#m-serial-json): header for importing / exporting the containers in [JSON format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).
* [m-serial-bin.h](#m-serial-bin): header for importing / exporting the containers in an adhoc binary format.
* [m-core.h](#m-core): header for meta-programming with the C preprocessor.

Finally headers for compatibility with non C11 compilers:

* [m-atomic.h](#m-atomic): header for ensuring compatibility between C's stdatomic.h and C++'s atomic header. Provide also an implementation over mutex if none is available.
* [m-mutex.h](#m-mutex): header for providing a very thin layer across multiple implementation of mutex/threads (C11/PTHREAD/WIN32).

Each containers define their iterators.

All containers try to expose the same interface:
if the method name is the same, then it does the same thing
and is used in the same way.
In some rare case, the method has to be adapted to the container.

Each header can be used separately from others: dependency between headers have been kept to the minimum.

Build & Installation
--------------------

M\*LIB is **only** composed of a set of headers, as such there is no build for the library.
The library doesn't depend on any other library than the LIBC.

To run the test suite, run:

       make check

To generate the documentation, run:

       make doc

To install the headers, run:

       make install PREFIX=/my/directory/where/to/install

Other targets exist. Mainly for development purpose.


How to use
----------

To use these data structures, you include the desired header,
instantiate the definition of the structure and its associated methods
by using a macro _DEF for the needed type.
Then you use the defined functions. Let's see a first simple example
that creates a list of unsigned int:

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include "m-list.h"
    
    LIST_DEF(list_uint, unsigned int)      /* Define struct list_uint_t and its methods */
    
    int main(void) {
       list_uint_t list ;             /* list_uint_t has been define above */
       list_uint_init(list);          /* All type needs to be initialized */
       list_uint_push_back(list, 42); /* Push 42 in the list */
       list_uint_push_back(list, 17); /* Push 17 in the list */
       list_uint_it_t it;             /* Define an iterator to scan each one */
       for(list_uint_it(it, list)     /* Start iterator on first element */
           ; !list_uint_end_p(it)     /* Until the end is not reached */
           ; list_uint_next(it)) {    /* Set the iterator to the next element*/
              printf("%d\n",          /* Get a reference to the underlying */
                *list_uint_cref(it)); /* data and print it */
       }
       list_uint_clear(list);         /* Clear all the list */
    }

[ Do not forget to add -std=c99 (or c11) to your compile command to request a C99 compatible build ]

This looks like a typical C program except the line with 'LIST\_DEF'
that doesn't have any semi-colon at the end. And in fact, except
this line, everything is typical C program and even macro free!
The only macro is in fact LIST\_DEF: this macro expands to the
good type for the list of the defined type and to all the necessary
functions needed to handle such type. It is heavily context dependent
and can generate different code depending on it.
You can use it as many times as needed to defined as many lists as you want.
The first argument of the macro is the name to use, e.g. the prefix that
shall be added to all generated functions and types.
The second argument of the macro is the type to embed within the container.
It can be any C type.
The third argument of the macro is optional and is the oplist to use.
See below for more information.


You could replace LIST\_DEF by ARRAY\_DEF to change
the kind of container (an array instead of a linked list)
without changing the code below: the generated interface
of a list or of an array is very similar.
Yet the performance remains the same as hand-written code
for both the list variant and the array variant.

This is equivalent to this C++ program using the STL:

    #include <iostream>
    #include <list>
    
    typedef std::list<unsigned int> list_uint_t;
    typedef std::list<unsigned int>::iterator list_uint_it_t;
    
    int main(void) {
       list_uint_t list ;             /* list_uint_t has been define above */
       list.push_back(42);            /* Push 42 in the list */
       list.push_back(17);            /* Push 17 in the list */
       for(list_uint_it_t it = list.begin()  /* Iterator is first element*/
           ; it != list.end()         /* Until the end is not reached */
           ; ++it) {                  /* Set the iterator to the next element*/
           std::cout << *it << '\n';  /* Print the underlying data */
       }
    }

As you can see, this is rather equivalent with the following remarks:

* M\*LIB requires an explicit definition of the instance of the list,
* M\*LIB code is more verbose in the method name,
* M\*LIB needs explicit construction and destruction (as plain old C requests),
* M\*LIB doesn't return a value to the underlying data but a pointer to this value:
  - this was done for performance (it avoids copying all the data within the stack)
  - and for generality reasons (some structure may not allow copying data).

Note: list\_uint\_t is internally defined as an array of structure of size 1.
This has the following advantages:

* you effectively reserve the data whenever you declare a variable,
* you pass automatically the variable per reference for function calls,
* you can not copy the variable by an affectation (you have to use the API instead).

You can also condense the M\*LIB code by using the M\_EACH & M\_LET macros if you are not afraid of using syntactic macros:

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include "m-list.h"
    
    LIST_DEF(list_uint, unsigned int)   /* Define struct list_uint_t and its methods */
    
    int main(void) {
       M_LET(list, LIST_OPLIST(uint)) { /* Define & init list as list_uint_t */
         list_uint_push_back(list, 42); /* Push 42 in the list */
         list_uint_push_back(list, 17); /* Push 17 in the list */
         for M_EACH(item, list, LIST_OPLIST(uint)) {
           printf("%d\n", *item);       /* Print the item */
         }
       }                                /* Clear of list will be done now */
    }

Here is another example with a complete type (with proper initialization & clear function) by using the [GMP](https://gmplib.org/) library:

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <gmp.h>
    #include "m-array.h"

    ARRAY_DEF(array_mpz, mpz_t, (INIT(mpz_init), INIT_SET(mpz_init_set), SET(mpz_set), CLEAR(mpz_clear)) )

    int main(void) {
       array_mpz_t array ;             /* array_mpz_t has been define above */
       array_mpz_init(array);          /* All type needs to be initialized */
       mpz_t z;                        /* Define a mpz_t type */
       mpz_init(z);                    /* Initialize the z variable */
       mpz_set_ui (z, 42);
       array_mpz_push_back(array, z);  /* Push 42 in the array */
       mpz_set_ui (z, 17);
       array_mpz_push_back(array, z); /* Push 17 in the array */
       array_it_mpz_t it;              /* Define an iterator to scan each one */
       for(array_mpz_it(it, array)     /* Start iterator on first element */
           ; !array_mpz_end_p(it)      /* Until the end is not reached */
           ; array_mpz_next(it)) {     /* Set the iterator to the next element*/
              gmp_printf("%Zd\n",      /* Get a reference to the underlying */
                *array_mpz_cref(it));  /* data and print it */
       }
       mpz_clear(z);                   /* Clear the z variable */
       array_mpz_clear(array);         /* Clear all the array */
    }

As the mpz\_t type needs proper initialization, copy and destroy functions
we need to tell to the container how to handle such a type.
This is done by giving it the oplist associated to the type.
An oplist is an associative array where the operators are associated to methods.
In the example, we tell to the container to use
the mpz\_init function for the INIT operator of the type,
the mpz\_clear function for the CLEAR operator of the type,
the mpz\_set function for the SET operator of the type,
the mpz\_init\_set function for the INIT\_SET operator of the type.
See oplist chapter for more information.

We can also write the same example shorter:

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <gmp.h>
    #include "m-array.h"
    
    // Register the oplist of a mpz_t. It is a classic oplist.
    #define M_OPL_mpz_t() M_CLASSIC_OPLIST(mpz)
    // Define an instance of an array of mpz_t (both type and function)
    ARRAY_DEF(array_mpz, mpz_t)
    // Register the oplist of the created instance of array of mpz_t
    #define M_OPL_array_mpz_t() ARRAY_OPLIST(array_mpz, M_OPL_mpz_t())
    
    int main(void) {
      // Let's define 'array' as an 'array_mpz_t' & initialize it.
      M_LET(array, array_mpz_t)
        // Let's define 'z1' and 'z2' to be 'mpz_t' & initialize it
        M_LET (z1, z2, mpz_t) {
         mpz_set_ui (z1, 42);
         array_mpz_push_back(array, z1);  /* Push 42 in the array */
         mpz_set_ui (z2, 17);
         array_mpz_push_back(array, z2); /* Push 17 in the array */
         // Let's iterate over all items of the container
         for M_EACH(item, array, array_mpz_t) {
              gmp_printf("%Zd\n", *item);
         }
      } // All variables are cleared with the proper method beyond this point.
      return 0;
    }

Or even shorter when you're comfortable enough with the library:

        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <gmp.h>
        #include "m-array.h"
        
        // Register the oplist of a mpz_t. It is a classic oplist.
        #define M_OPL_mpz_t() M_OPEXTEND(M_CLASSIC_OPLIST(mpz), INIT_WITH(mpz_init_set_ui) )
        // Define an instance of an array of mpz_t (both type and function)
        ARRAY_DEF(array_mpz, mpz_t)
        // Register the oplist of the created instance of array of mpz_t
        #define M_OPL_array_mpz_t() ARRAY_OPLIST(array_mpz, M_OPL_mpz_t())
        
        int main(void) {
          // Let's define & init 'z1=42' and 'z2=17' to be 'mpz_t'
          M_LET ((z1,42), (z2,17), mpz_t)
            // Let's define 'array' as an 'array_mpz_t' with 'z1' and 'z2'
            M_LET((array,z1,z2), array_mpz_t) {
             // Let's iterate over all items of the container
             for M_EACH(item, array, array_mpz_t) {
                  gmp_printf("%Zd\n", *item);
             }
          } // All variables are cleared with the proper method beyond this point.
          return 0;
        }


There are two ways a container can known what is the oplist of a type:

* either the oplist is passed explicitly for each definition of container and for the LET & EACH macros,
* or the oplist is registered globally by defining a new macro starting with the prefix M\_OPL\_ and finishing with the name of type (don't forget the parenthesis). The macros performing the definition of container and the LET & EACH will test if such macro is defined. If it is defined, it will be used. Otherwise default methods are used.

Here we can see that we register the mpz\_t type into the container with
the minimum information of its interface needed.

We can also see in this example so the container ARRAY provides also
a macro to define the oplist of the array itself. This is true for
all containers and this enables to define proper recursive container like in this example
which reads from a text file a definition of sections:

        #include <stdio.h>
        #include "m-array.h"
        #include "m-tuple.h"
        #include "m-dict.h"
        #include "m-string.h"
        
        TUPLE_DEF2(symbol, (offset, long), (value, long))
        #define M_OPL_symbol_t() TUPLE_OPLIST(symbol, M_DEFAULT_OPLIST, M_DEFAULT_OPLIST)
        
        ARRAY_DEF(array_symbol, symbol_t)
        #define M_OPL_array_symbol_t() ARRAY_OPLIST(array_symbol, M_OPL_symbol_t())
        
        DICT_DEF2(sections, string_t, array_symbol_t)
        #define M_OPL_sections_t() DICT_OPLIST(sections, STRING_OPLIST, M_OPL_array_symbol_t())
        
        int main(int argc, const char *argv[])
        {
          if (argc < 2) abort();
          FILE *f = fopen(argv[1], "rt");
          if (!f) abort();
          M_LET(sc, sections_t) {
            sections_in_str(sc, f);
            array_symbol_t *a = sections_get(sc, STRING_CTE(".text"));
            if (a == NULL) {
              printf("There is no .text section.");
            } else {
              printf("Section .text is :");
              array_symbol_out_str(stdout, *a);
              printf("\n");
            }
          }
          return 0;
        }

This example reads the data from a file
and outputs the .text section if it finds it on the terminal.

Other examples are available in the example folder.

Internal fields of the structure are subject to change even for small revision
of the library.

The final goal of the library is to be able to write code like this in pure C while keeping type safety and compile time name resolution:

	let(list, list_uint_t) {
	  push(list, 42);
	  push(list, 17);
	  for each (item, list) {
	    print(item, "\n");
	  }
	}


OPLIST
------

An OPLIST is a fundamental notion of M\*LIB that hasn't be used in any other library.
In order to know how to operate on a type, M\*LIB needs additional information
as the compiler doesn't know how to handle properly any type (contrary to C++).
This is done by giving an operator list (or oplist in short) to any macro that
needs to handle the type. As such, an oplist as only meaning within a macro
expansion. Fundamentally, this is the exposed interface of a type with documented
operators using an associative array implemented with the only C preprocessor
where the operators are the predefined keys and the methods are the values.

An oplist is an associative array of operator over methods in the following format:

(OPERATOR1(method1), OPERATOR2(method2), ...)

The function 'method1' is used to handle 'OPERATOR1'.
The function 'method2' is used to handle 'OPERATOR2'. etc.
The order of the operator in this list is the priority order:
in case the same operator appear multiple times in the list,
the first one is the priority.

It is used to perform the association between the operation on a type
and the function that performs this operation.
Without an oplist, M\*LIB has no way to known how to deal with your type
and will deal with it like a classic C type.

When you define an instance of a new container, you give the type oplist
you want to use as the base of the container. This type oplist performs
the association between the operators and the methods for the type.
In function of the available interface of the oplist, the container definition macro
function generates the interface of the container. You can then use this interface
directly. You can also use the oplist of the container to chain this new interface
with another container, creating container-of-container.
![oplist and definition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/P-p-H-d/mlib/master/doc/oplist.png)

A function name can be followed by the token M\_IPTR in the oplist
(for example: (INIT(init\_func M\_IPTR)) )
to specify that the function accept as its *first* argument a pointer
to the type rather than the type itself
(aka the prototype is init\_func(type *) instead of init\_func(type)).
If you use the '[1]' trick (see below), you won't need this.
See also the API\_* transformation call below for further transformation
means of the calls.

An oplist has no real form from a C language point of view. It is just an abstraction
that disappears after the macro expansion step of the preprocessing.

For each object / container, an oplist is needed and the following operators are
expected for an object otherwise default constructors are used:

* INIT constructor(obj): initialize the object 'obj' into a valid state.
* INIT\_SET constructor(obj, org): initialize the object 'obj' into the same state as the object 'org'.
* SET operator(obj, org): set the initialized object 'obj' into the same state as the initialized object org.
* CLEAR destructor(obj): destroy the initialized object 'obj', releasing any attached memory. This method shall never fail.

INIT, INIT\_SET & SET methods shall only fail due to ***memory errors***.

Not all operators are needed within an oplist to handle a container.
If some operator is missing, the associated default operator of the function is used.
To use C integer or float types, the default constructors are perfectly fine:
you may use M\_DEFAULT\_OPLIST to define the operator list of such types or you
can just omit it.

NOTE: An iterator doesn't have a constructor nor destructor methods
and it shall not allocate any memory.

Other documented operators are:

* NEW (type) -> type pointer: allocate a new object (with suitable alignment and size) and return a pointer to it. The returned object is **not initialized** (INIT operator shall be called afterward). The default method is M\_MEMORY\_ALLOC (that allocates from the heap). It returns NULL in case of failure.
* DEL (&obj): free the allocated uninitialized object 'obj'. The object is not cleared before being free (CLEAR operator shall be called before). The object shall have been allocated by the associated NEW method. The default method is M\_MEMORY\_DEL (that frees to the heap).
* REALLOC(type, type pointer, number) --> type pointer: realloc the given array referenced by type pointer (either a NULL pointer or a pointer returned by the associated REALLOC method itself) to an array of the number of objects of this type and return a pointer to this new array. Previously objects pointed by the pointer are kept up to the minimum of the new size and old one. New objects are not initialized (INIT operator shall be called afterward). Freed objects are not cleared (CLEAR operator shall be called before). The default is M\_MEMORY\_REALLOC (that allocates from the heap). It returns NULL in case of failure in which case the original array is not modified.
* FREE (&obj) : free the allocated uninitialized array object 'obj'. The objects are not cleared before being free (CLEAR operator has to be called before).  The object shall have been allocated by the associated REALLOC method. The default is M\_MEMORY\_FREE (that frees to the heap).
* INC\_ALLOC(size\_t s) -> size\_t: Define the growing policy of an array (or equivalent structure). It returns a new allocation size based on the old allocation size ('s'). Default policy is to get the max between '2*s' and 16. If the returned value is lower than the old one, it is assumed that the size has overflowed.
* INIT\_MOVE(objd, objc): Initialize 'objd' to the same state than 'objc' by stealing as much resources as possible from 'objc', and then clear 'objc'. It is semantically equivalent to calling INIT\_SET(objd,objc) then CLEAR(objc) but is usually way faster. By default, all objects are assumed to be **trivially movable** (i.e. using memcpy to move an object is safe). Most C objects (even complex structure) are trivially movable. A notable exception are (in general) intrusive objects. If an object is not trivially movable, it shall provide an INIT\_MOVE method or disable the INIT\_MOVE method entirely.
* MOVE(objd, objc): Set 'objd' to the same state than 'objc' by stealing as resources as possible from 'objc' and then clear 'objc'. It is equivalent to calling SET(objd,objc) then CLEAR(objc) or CLEAR(objd) and then INIT\_MOVE(objd, objc). TBC if operator is really needed as calling CLEAR then INIT\_MOVE is what do all known implementation.
* INIT\_WITH(obj, ...): Initialize the object 'obj' with a variable set of arguments. Arguments can be of different types and is up to the method to decide how to initialize the object based on this set. This is used in the M\_LET macro to initialize objects with the given values.
* SWAP(objd, objc): Swap the states of the object 'objc' and the object 'objd'.
* CLEAN(obj): Empty the container from all its objects. Nearly like CLEAR except that the container 'obj' remains initialized (but empty).
* HASH (obj) --> size_t: return a hash of the object (not a secure hash but one that is usable for a hash table). Default is performing a hash of the memory representation of the object. This default implementation is invalid if the object holds pointer to other objects.
* EQUAL(obj1, obj2) --> bool: return true if both objects are equal, false otherwise. Default is using the C comparison operator. The method may be called with OOR object for the Open Addressing dictionary (in which case it shall return false).
* CMP(obj1, obj2) --> int: return a negative integer if obj1 < obj2, 0 if obj1 = obj2, a positive integer otherwise. Default is C comparison operators.
* ADD(obj1, obj2, obj3) : set obj1 to the sum of obj2 and obj3. Default is '+' C operator.
* SUB(obj1, obj2, obj3) : set obj1 to the difference of obj2 and obj3. Default is '-' C operator.
* MUL(obj1, obj2, obj3) : set obj1 to the product of obj2 and obj3. Default is '*' C operator.
* DIV(obj1, obj2, obj3) : set obj1 to the division of obj2 and obj3. Default is '/' C operator.
* KEY_TYPE() --> key_t: Return the type of key for associative containers.
* VALUE_TYPE() --> value_t: Return the type of value for associative containers.
* KEY_OPLIST() --> oplist: Return the oplist of the key for associative containers.
* VALUE_OPLIST() --> oplist: Return the oplist of the value for associative containers.
* GET\_KEY (container, key) --> &obj: return a pointer to the object within the container associated to the key 'key' or return NULL if no object is associated to this key. The pointer to the object remains valid until any modification of the container. 
* SET\_KEY (container, key, object): Associate in the container the key 'key' to the object 'object'. 
* GET\_SET\_KEY (container, key) --> &obj: return a pointer to the object within the container associated to the key 'key' or create a new object in the container, associate it to the key 'key' and return its pointer. The pointer to the object remains valid until any modification of the container. The returned pointer cannot be NULL.
* ERASE\_KEY (container, key) --> bool: true to erase the object associated to the key 'key' within the container. Return true if successful, false if the key is not found.
* GET\_SIZE (container) --> size_t: return the number of elements in the container.
* PUSH(container, obj) : push 'object' into 'container'. How it is pushed is container dependent.
* POP(&obj, container) : pop an object from 'container' and save it in '*obj' if obj is not NULL (giving back the ownership to the caller). Which object is popped is container dependent. It is assumed that there is at least one object in the container.
* PUSH_MOVE(container, &obj) : push and move the object '*obj' into 'container'. How it is pushed is container dependent but '*obj' is cleared afterward.
* POP_MOVE(&obj, container) : pop an object from 'container' and init & move it in '*obj'. Which object is popped is container dependent. '*obj' shall be uninitialized. Undefined behavior is there is no object in the container.
* SPLICE\_BACK(containerDst, containerSrc, it): move the object referenced by the iterator 'it' from 'containerSrc' into 'containerDst'. Where is move is container dependent. Afterward 'it' points to the next item in 'containerSrc'.
* SPLICE\_AT(containerDst, itDst, containerSrc, itSrc): move the object referenced by the iterator 'itSrc' from 'containerSrc' just after the object referenced by the iterator 'itDst' in 'containerDst'. If 'itDst' doesn't reference a valid object, it is inserted as the first item of the container (See method 'INSERT'). Afterward 'itSrc' references the next item in 'containerSrc'and 'itDst' references the moved item in 'containerDst'.
* TYPE() --> type: return the type associated to this oplist.
* SUBTYPE() --> type: return the type of the element stored in the container.
* OPLIST() --> oplist: return the oplist of the type of the elements stored in the container.
* IT\_TYPE() --> type: return the type of an iterator object of this container.
* IT\_FIRST(it\_obj, container): set the object iterator it\_obj to the first sub-element of container.
* IT\_LAST(it\_obj, container): set the object iterator it\_obj to the last sub-element of container.
* IT\_END(it\_obj, container): set the object iterator it\_obj to the end of the container (Can't use PREVIOUS or NEXT afterward).
* IT\_SET(it\_obj, it\_obj2): set the object iterator it\_obj to it\_obj2.
* IT\_END\_P(it\_obj)--> bool: return true if it\_obj references an end of the container.
* IT\_LAST\_P(it\_obj)--> bool: return true if the iterator it\_obj has reached an end or if the iterator points to the last element (just before the end).
* IT\_EQUAL\_P(it\_obj, it\_obj2) --> bool: return true if both iterators references the same element.
* IT\_NEXT(it\_obj): move the iterator to the next sub-component.
* IT\_PREVIOUS(it\_obj): move the iterator to the previous sub-component.
* IT\_CREF(it\_obj) --> &obj: return a constant pointer to the object referenced by the iterator.
* IT\_REF(it\_obj) --> &obj: return a pointer to the object referenced by the iterator.
* IT\_REMOVE(container, it\_obj): remove it\_obj from the container (clearing it) and update it\_obj to point to the next object. All other iterators of the same container become invalidated.
* OUT\_STR(FILE* f, obj): Output 'obj' as a string into the FILE stream 'f'.
* IN\_STR(obj, FILE* f) --> bool: Set 'obj' to the string object in the FILE stream 'f'. Return true in case of success (in that case the stream 'f' has been advanced to the end of the parsing of the object), false otherwise (in that case, the stream 'f' is in an undetermined position).
* GET\_STR(string_t str, obj, bool append): Set 'str' to a string representation of the object 'obj'. Append to the string if 'append' is true, set it otherwise.
* PARSE\_STR(obj, const char *str, const char **endp) --> bool: Set 'obj' to the string object in the char stream 'str'. Return true in case of success (in that case if endp is not NULL, it points to the end of the parsing of the object), false otherwise (in that case, if endp is not NULL, it points to an undetermined position).
* OUT\_SERIAL(m\_serial\_write\_t *serial, obj) --> m\_serial\_return\_code\_t : Output 'obj' into the configurable serialization stream 'serial' (See #[m-serial-json.h](#m-serial-json) for details and example). Return M\_SERIAL\_OK\_DONE in case of success, or M\_SERIAL\_FAIL otherwise .
* IN\_SERIAL(obj, m\_serial\_read\_t *serial) --> m\_serial\_return\_code\_t: Set 'obj' to its representation from the configurable serialization stream 'serial' (See #[m-serial-json.h](#m-serial-json) for details and example). M\_SERIAL\_OK\_DONE in case of success (in that case the stream 'serial' has been advanced up to the complete parsing of the object), or M\_SERIAL\_FAIL otherwise (in that case, the stream 'serial' is in an undetermined position but usually around the next characters after the first failure).
* UPDATE(dest, src): Update 'dest' with 'src'. What it does exactly is node dependent: it can either SET or ADD to the node the new 'src' (default is SET).
* OOR\_SET(obj, int\_value): some containers may want to store some information within some uninitialized objects (for example Open Addressing Hash Table). This method will store the integer value 'int\_value' into the uninitialized object 'obj'. The way to store this information is object dependent. In general, you use out-of-range value for detecting such values. The object remains uninitialized but set to of out-of-range value (OOR). int\_value values can be 0 or 1.
* OOR\_EQUAL(obj, int\_value): This method will compare the object 'obj' to the out-of-range value (OOR) used to represent int\_value and return true if both objects are equal.
* REVERSE(container) : Reverse the order of the items in the container.
* SEPARATOR() --> character: Return the character used to separate items in I/O (default is ',')
* EXT\_ALGO(name, container oplist, object oplist): Define additional algorithms functions specialized for the containers (for internal use only).

More operators are expected.

Example:

        (INIT(mpz_init),SET(mpz_set),INIT_SET(mpz_init_set),CLEAR(mpz_clear))

If there is two operations with the same name in an oplist, the left one has the priority. This enables partial overriding.

Oplists can be registered globally by defining, for the type 'type', a macro named
M\_OPL\_ ## type () that expands to the oplist of the type.
Only type without space in their name can be registered. A typedef of the type
can be used instead through.

Example:

        #define M_OPL_mpz_t() M_CLASSIC_OPLIST(mpz)

Within an OPLIST, you can specify the API needed transformation to perform for the method.
Assuming that the method to call is called 'method' and the first argument of the operator is 'output',
then the following transformation are applied:

* API\_0: method(output, ...)  /* Default API */
* API\_1: method(oplist, output, ...) /* Give oplist to the method */
* API\_2: method(&output, ...) /* Pass by address the first argument (like with M\_IPTR) */
* API\_3: method(oplist, &output, ...) /* Pass by address the first argument (like with M\_IPTR) and give the oplist of the type */
* API\_4 : output = method(...) /* Pass by return value the first argument */
* API\_5:  output = method(oplist, ...) /* Pass by return value the first argument and give the oplist of the type*/
* API\_6 : method(&output, &...) /* Pass by address the two first arguments */
* API\_7:  method(oplist, &output, &...) /* Pass by address the two first argument and give the oplist of the type*/

Example:

        (INIT(API_0(mpz_init)), SET(API_0(mpz_set)), INIT_SET(API_0(mpz_init_set)), CLEAR(API_0(mpz_clear)))



### Which OPLIST to use?

My type is:

* a C integer or a C float: M\_DEFAULT\_OPLIST (it can also be ommited),
* a pointer to something: M\_PTR\_OPLIST,
* a plain structure that can be init/copy/compare with memset/memcpy/memcmp: M\_POD\_OPLIST,
* a plain structure that is passed by reference using [1] and can be init,copy,compare with memset,memcpy,memcmp: M\_A1\_OPLIST,
* a type that offers name\_init, name\_init\_set, name\_set, name\_clear methods: M\_CLASSIC\_OPLIST,
* a const string (const char *): M\_CSTR\_OPLIST,
* a M\*LIB string\_t: STRING\_OPLIST,
* a M\*LIB container: the OPLIST of the used container,
* other things: you need to provide a custom OPLIST to your type.

Note: The precise exported methods of the oplists depend of the version
of the C language used. Typically, in C11 mode, the M\_DEFAULT\_OPLIST
exports all needed methods to handle generc input/output of int/floats
(using _Generic) whereas it is not possible in C99 mode.
This explains why JSON import/export is only available in C11 mode
(See below chapter).


Memory Allocation
-----------------

Memory Allocation functions can be globally set by overriding the following macros before using the definition _DEF macros:

* M\_MEMORY\_ALLOC (type): return a pointer to a new object of type 'type'.
* M\_MEMORY\_DEL (ptr): free the single object pointed by 'ptr'.
* M\_MEMORY\_REALLOC (type, ptr, number): return a pointer to an array of 'number' objects of type 'type', reusing the old array pointed by 'ptr'. 'ptr' can be NULL, in that case the array will be created.
* M\_MEMORY\_FREE (ptr): free the array of objects pointed by 'ptr'.

ALLOC & DEL operators are supposed to allocate fixed size single element object (no array).
Theses objects are not expected to grow.
REALLOC & FREE operators deal with allocated memory for growing objects.
Do not mix pointers between both: a pointer allocated by ALLOC (resp. REALLOC) is supposed
to be only freed by DEL (resp. FREE). There are separated 'free' operators to enable
specialization in the allocator (a good allocator can take this hint into account).

M\_MEMORY\_ALLOC and  M\_MEMORY\_REALLOC are supposed to return NULL in case of memory allocation failure.
The defaults are 'malloc', 'free', 'realloc' and 'free'.

You can also override the methods NEW, DEL, REALLOC & DEL in the oplist given to a container
so that only the container will use these memory allocation functions.


Out-of-memory error
-------------------

When a memory exhaustion is reached, the global macro "M\_MEMORY\_FULL" is called
and the function returns immediately after.
The object remains in a valid (if previously valid) and unchanged state in this case.

By default, the macro prints an error message and aborts the program:
handling non-trivial memory errors can be hard,
testing them is even harder but still mandatory to avoid security holes.
So the default behavior shall be rather conservative.

Moreover a good program design should handle a process entire failure (using for examples multiple
processes for doing the job) so even if a process stops, it shall be recovered.
See [here](http://joeduffyblog.com/2016/02/07/the-error-model/) for more
information about why abandonment is good software practice.

It can however be overloaded to handle other policy for error handling like:

* throwing an error (in that case, the user is responsible to free memory of the allocated objects - destructor can still be called),
* set a global error and handle it when the function returns,
* other policy.

This function takes the size in bytes of the memory that has been tried to be allocated.

If needed, this macro shall be defined ***prior*** to instantiate the structure.

NOTE: Throwing an error is not fully supported yet. Some help from the library
is needed to avoid losing memory. See issue #15.


ERRORS & COMPILERS
------------------

When defining the oplist of a type using M\*LIB, sometimes (often) the list of errors/warnings generated
by the compiler can be (very) huge (specially with latest compilers),
even if the error itself is minor. This is more or less the same as the use of template in C++.
You should focus mainly on the first reported error/warning
even if the link between what the compiler report and what the error is
is not immediate. The error is always in the **oplist definition**.
Examples of typical errors:

* lack of inclusion of an header,
* overriding locally operator names by macros (like NEW, DEL, INIT, OPLIST, ...),
* lack of ( ) or double level of ( ) around the oplist,
* an unknown variable (example using DEFAULT\_OPLIST instead of M\_DEFAULT\_OPLIST or M\_STRING\_OPLIST instead of STRING\_OPLIST),
* a missing argument,
* a missing mandatory operator in the oplist.

A good way to avoid theses errors is to register the oplist globally as soon
as you define the container.

Another way to debug is to generate the preprocessed file
(by usually calling the compiler with the '-E' option instead of '-c')
and check what's wrong in the preprocessed file:

          cc -std=c99 -E test-file.c > test-file.i
          perl -pi -e 's/;/;\n/g' test-file.i
          cc -std=c99 -c -Wall test-file.i

If there is a warning reported by the compiler in the generated code,
then there is definitely an **error** you should fix (except if it reports
shadowed variables).

Each can be classified into one of the following concept:

* Each object is handled through a pointer to void (with potential registered callbacks to handle the contained objects for the specialized methods). From a user point of view, this makes the code harder to use (as you don't have any help from the compiler) and type unsafe with a lot of cast (so no formal proof of the code is possible). This also generally generate slower code (even if using link time optimization, this penalty can be reduced). Properly used, it can yet be the most space efficient for the code, but can consume a lot more for the data due to the obligation of using pointers. This is however the easiest to design & code.
* Macros are used to access structures in a generic way (using known fields of a structure - typically size, number, etc.). From a user point of view, this can create subtitle bug in the use of the library (as everything is done through macro expansion in the user defined code) or hard to understand warnings. This can generates fully efficient code. From a library developer point of view, this can be quite limiting in what you can offer.
* A known structure is put in an intrusive way in the type of all the objects you wan to handle. From a user point of view, he needs to modify its structure and has to perform all the allocation & deallocation code itself (which is good or bad depending on the context). This can generate efficient code (both in speed and size). From a library developer point of view, this is easy to design & code. You need internally a cast to go from a pointer to the known structure to the pointed object (a reverse of offsetof) that is generally type unsafe (except if mixed with the macro generating concept). This is quite limitation in what you can do: you can't move your objects so any container that has to move some objects is out-of-question (which means that you cannot use the most efficient container).
* Header files are included multiple times with different contexts (some different values given to defined macros) in order to generate different code for each type. From a user point of view, this creates a new step before using the container: an instantiating stage that has to be done once per type and per compilation unit (The user is responsible to create only one instance of the container, which can be troublesome if the library doesn't handle proper prefix for its naming convention). The debug of the library is generally easy and can generate fully specialized & efficient code. Incorrectly used, this can generate a lot of code bloat. Properly used, this can even create smaller code than the void pointer variant. The interface used to configure the library can be quite tiresome in case of a lot of specialized methods to configure: it doesn't enable to chain the configuration from a container to another one easily. It also cannot have heavy customization of the code.
* Macros are used to generate context-dependent C code enabling to generate code for different type. This is pretty much like the headers solution but with added flexibility. From a user point of view, this creates a new step before using the container: an instantiating stage that has to be done once per type and per compilation unit (The user is responsible to create only one instance of the container, which can be troublesome if the library doesn't handle proper prefix for its naming convention). This can generate fully specialized & efficient code. Incorrectly used, this can generate a lot of code bloat. Properly used, this can even create smaller code than the void pointer variant. From a library developer point of view, the library is harder to design and to debug: everything being expanded in one line, you can't step in the library (there is however a solution to overcome this limitation by adding another stage to the compilation process). You can however see the generated code by looking at the preprocessed file. You can perform heavy context-dependent customization of the code (transforming the macro preprocessing step into its own language). Properly done, you can also chain the methods from a container to another one easily, enabling expansion of the library. Errors within the macro expansion are generally hard to decipher, but errors in code using containers are easy to read and natural.

M\*LIB's category is mainly the last one.
Some macros are also defined to access structure in a generic way, but they are optional.
There are also intrusive containers.

M\*LIB main added value compared to other libraries is its oplist feature
enabling it to chain the containers and/or use complex types in containers:
list of array of dictionary of C++ objects are perfectly supported by M\*LIB.

For the macro-preprocessing part, other libraries also exist. For example:

* [P99](http://p99.gforge.inria.fr/p99-html/)

API Documentation
-----------------

The M*LIB reference card is available [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/P-p-H-d/mlib/blob/master/doc/Container.html).


### M-LIST

This header is for creating [singly linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list).

A linked list is a linear collection of elements,
in which each element points to the next, all representing a sequence.

#### LIST\_DEF(name, type, [, oplist])

Define the singly linked list named 'name##\_t' that contains objects of type 'type' and the associated methods as "static inline" functions.
'name' shall be a C identifier that will be used to identify the list. It will be used to create all the types and functions to handle the container.
This definition shall be done once per name and per compilation unit.
It also define the iterator name##\_it\_t and its associated methods as "static inline" functions.

A fundamental property of a list is that the objects created within the list
will remain at their initialized address, and won't moved due to
operations done on the list (except if it is removed).

The type oplist is expected to have at least the following operators (INIT\_SET, SET and CLEAR).
If there is no given oplist, the default oplist for standard C type is used
or a globally registered oplist is used if there is one available.
The created methods use the operators to init, set and clear the contained object.

For this structure, the back is always the first element,
and the front is the last element: the list grows from the back.

Example:

	LIST_DEF(list_uint, unsigned int)

	list_uint_t list_of_integer;

	void fi(unsigned int z) {
		list_uint_push_back (list_of_integer, z);
	}
        
	LIST_DEF(list_mpz, mpz_t,                                               \
		(INIT(mpz_init), INIT_SET(mpz_init_set), SET(mpz_set), CLEAR(mpz_clear)))

	list_mpz_t my_list;

	void fz(mpz_t z) {
		list_mpz_push_back (my_list, z);
	}

If the given oplist contain the method MEMPOOL, then LIST\_DEF macro will create
a dedicated mempool that is named with the given value of the method MEMPOOL.
This mempool (see mempool chapter) is optimized for this kind of list:

* it creates a mempool named by the concatenation of "name" and "\_mempool",
* it creates a variable named by the value of the method MEMPOOL with the linkage
defined by the value of the method MEMPOOL\_LINKAGE (can be extern, static or none).
This variable is shared by all lists of the same type.
* it links the memory allocation of the list to use this mempool with this variable.

mempool create heavily efficient list. However it is only worth the
effort in some heavy performance context.
The created mempool has to be explicitly initialized before using any
methods of the created list by calling  mempool\_list\_name\_init(variable)
and cleared by calling mempool\_list\_name\_clear(variable).

Example:

        LIST_DEF(list_uint, unsigned int, (MEMPOOL(list_mpool), MEMPOOL_LINKAGE(static)))

        static void test_list (size_t n)
        {
          list_uint_mempool_init(list_mpool);
          M_LET(a1, LIST_OPLIST(uint)) {
              for(size_t i = 0; i < n; i++)
                  list_uint_push_back(a1, rand_get() );
          }
          list_uint_mempool_clear(list_mpool);
        }


#### LIST\_OPLIST(name [, oplist])

Return the oplist of the list defined by calling LIST\_DEF
& LIST\_DUAL\_PUSH\_DEF with name & oplist. 
If there is no given oplist, the default oplist for standard C type is used.

#### Created methods

In the following methods, name stands for the name given to the macro that is used to identify the type.
The following types are automatically defined by the previous definition macro:

#### name\_t

Type of the list of 'type'.

#### name\_it\_t

Type of an iterator over this list.

The following methods are automatically created by the previous definition macro:

##### void name\_init(name\_t list)

Initialize the list 'list' (aka constructor) to an empty list.

#### LIST\_DUAL\_PUSH\_DEF(name, type[, oplist])

Define the singly linked list named 'name##\_t' that contains the objects 
of type 'type' and the associated methods as "static inline" functions.
'name' shall be a C identifier that will be used to identify the list. 
It will be used to create all the types and functions to handle the container.
It shall be done once per type and per compilation unit.
It also define the iterator name##\_it\_t and its associated methods as "static inline" functions too.

The only difference with the list defined by LIST\_DEF is
the support of the method PUSH\_FRONT in addition to PUSH\_BACK 
(therefore the DUAL PUSH name).
There is still only POP method (POP\_BACK). The head of the list is a bit
bigger to be able to handle such methods to work.
This enables this list to be able to represent both stack (PUSH\_BACK + POP\_BACK)
and queue (PUSH\_FRONT + POP\_BACK).

A fundamental property of a list is that the objects created within the list
will remain at their initialized address, and won't moved due to
operations on the list.

The object oplist is expected to have at least the following operators (INIT\_SET, SET and CLEAR).
If there is no given oplist, the default oplist for standard C type is used
or a globally registered oplist is used.
The created methods will use the operators to init, set and clear the contained object.

For this structure, the back is always the first element, and the front is the last element.

Example:

	LIST_DUAL\_PUSH\_DEF(list_mpz, mpz_t,                                   \
		(INIT(mpz_init), INIT_SET(mpz_init_set), SET(mpz_set), CLEAR(mpz_clear)))

	list_mpz_t my_list;

	void f(mpz_t z) {
		list_mpz_push_front (my_list, z);
		list_mpz_pop_back (z, my_list);
	}

If the given oplist contain the method MEMPOOL, then macro will create a dedicated mempool
that is named with the given value of the method MEMPOOL, optimized for this kind of list:

* it creates a mempool named by the concatenation of "name" and "\_mempool",
* it creates a variable named by the value of the method MEMPOOL with linkage defined
by the value of the method MEMPOOL\_LINKAGE (can be extern, static or none),
this variable will be shared by all lists of the same type.
* it overwrites memory allocation of the created list to use this mempool with this variable.

mempool creates heavily efficient list but it will be only worth the effort in some
heavy performance context. The created mempool has to be initialized before using any
methods of the created list by calling  mempool\_list\_name\_init(variable)
and cleared by calling mempool\_list\_name\_clear(variable).

The methods follow closely the methods defined by LIST\_DEF.

### M-DEQUE

This header is for creating [double-ended queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-ended_queue) (or deque). 
A deque is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue, 
for that elements can be added to or removed from either the front (head) or back (tail)

#### DEQUE\_DEF(name, type, [, opdeque])

Define the deque 'name##\_t' that contains the objects of type 'type' and its associated methods as "static inline" functions.
'name' shall be a C identifier that will be used to identify the deque. It will be used to create all the types and functions to handle the container.
It shall be done once per type and per compilation unit.
It also define the iterator name##\_it\_t and its associated methods as "static inline" functions.

The object oplist is expected to have at least the following operators (INIT, INIT\_SET, SET and CLEAR),
otherwise default operators are used. If there is no given oplist, the default oplist for standard C type is used
or a globally registered oplist is used.
The created methods will use the operators to init, set and clear the contained object.

Example:

	DEQUE_DEF(deque_mpz, mpz_t,                                               \

### M-DICT

A [dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array) (or associative array, map, symbol table) is an abstract data type
composed of a collection of (key, value) pairs,
such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection.

Several dictionnaries are proposed. The "best" to use depends on the data type
and in particular:

* the size of the data,
* the inner cost of copying the object,
* the inner cost of computing the hash of the object,
* the inner cost of comparing the objects,
* the load factor.

For small, fast types (integer, or floats, or pair of such types),
DICT\_OA\_DEF2 may be the best to use.
For medium type, DICT\_DEF2 with mempool activated may be better.
For even larger object, DICT\_STOREHASH\_DEF2 may be better.


#### DICT\_DEF2(name, key\_type[, key\_oplist], value\_type[, value\_oplist])

Define the dictionary 'name##\_t' and its associated methods as "static inline" functions.
'name' shall be a C identifier that will be used to identify the container.
Current implementation uses chained Hash-Table and as such, elements in the dictionary are **unordered**.

It shall be done once per type and per compilation unit.
It also define the iterator name##\_it\_t and its associated methods as "static inline" functions.

The object oplist is expected to have at least the following operators (INIT, INIT\_SET, SET and CLEAR),
otherwise default operators are used. If there is no given oplist, the default oplist for standard C type is used
or a globally registered oplist is used.
The created methods will use the operators to init, set and clear the contained object.

The key_oplist shall also define the additional operators (HASH and EQUAL).

Example:

	DICT_DEF2(dict_str, string_t, STRING_OPLIST, string_t, STRING_OPLIST)
	dict_str_t my_dict;
	void f(string_t key, string_t value) {
		dict_str_set_at (my_dict, key, value);
	}


#### DICT\_STOREHASH\_DEF2(name, key\_type[, key\_oplist], value\_type[, value\_oplist])

Define the dictionary 'name##\_t' and its associated methods as "static inline" functions
just like DICT\_DEF2.

The only difference is that it stores the hash of each key alongside the key in the dictionary.
This enable the container to avoid recomputing it in some occasions resulting in faster
dictionary if the hash is costly to compute, or slower otherwise.


#### DICT\_OA\_DEF2(name, key\_type[, key\_oplist], value\_type[, value\_oplist])

Define the dictionary 'name##\_t' and its associated methods
as "static inline" functions much like DICT\_DEF2.
The difference is that it uses an Open Addressing Hash-Table as 
container.

It shall be done once per type and per compilation unit.
It also define the iterator name##\_it\_t and its associated methods as "static inline" functions.

The object oplist is expected to have at least the following operators (INIT, INIT\_SET, SET and CLEAR),
otherwise default operators are used. If there is no given oplist, the default oplist for standard C type is used
or a globally registered oplist is used.
The created methods will use the operators to init, set and clear the contained object.

The key_oplist shall also define the additional operators :
HASH and EQUAL and **OOR\_EQUAL** and **OOR\_SET**

This implementation is in general faster for small types of keys
(like integer) but slower for larger types.

Example:

	static inline bool oor_equal_p(int k, unsigned char n) {
	  return k == (int)-n-1;
	}
	static inline void oor_set(int *k, unsigned char n) {
	  *k = (int)-n-1;
	}

	DICT_OA_DEF2(dict_int, int, M_OPEXTEND(M_DEFAULT_OPLIST, OOR_EQUAL(oor_equal_p), OOR_SET(oor_set M_IPTR)), int64_t, M_DEFAULT_OPLIST)

	dict_int_t my_dict;
	void f(int key, int64_t value) {
		dict_int_set_at (my_dict, key, value);
	}


#### DICT\_OPLIST(name[, key\_oplist, value\_oplist])

Return the oplist of the dictionary defined by calling DICT\_DEF2 with name & key\_oplist & value\_oplist. 


#### DICT\_SET\_DEF(name, key\_type[, key\_oplist])

Define the set 'name##\_t' and its associated methods as "static inline" functions.
A set is a specialized version of a dictionary with no value.

It shall be done once per type and per compilation unit.
It also define the iterator name##\_it\_t and its associated methods as "static inline" functions.

The object oplist is expected to have at least the following operators (INIT, INIT\_SET, SET, CLEAR, HASH and EQUAL),
otherwise default operators are used. If there is no given oplist, the default oplist for standard C type is used
or a globally registered oplist is used.
The created methods will use the operators to init, set and clear the contained object.

Example:

	DICT_SET_DEF(dict_strSet, string_t)
	dict_strSet_t set;
	void f(string_t key) {
		dict_strSet_set_at (set, key);
	}

#### DICT\_OASET\_DEF(name, key\_type[, key\_oplist])

Define the set 'name##\_t' and its associated methods as "static inline" functions.
A set is a specialized version of a dictionary with no value.
The difference is that it uses an Open Addressing Hash-Table as 
container.

It shall be done once per type and per compilation unit.
It also define the iterator name##\_it\_t and its associated methods as "static inline" functions.

The key_oplist shall therefore define the additional operators :
HASH and EQUAL and **OOR\_EQUAL** and **OOR\_SET**

This implementation is in general faster for small types of keys
(like integer) but slower for larger types.


#### DICT\_SET\_OPLIST(name[, key\_oplist])

Return the oplist of the set defined by calling DICT\_SET\_DEF (or DICT\_OASET\_DEF) with name & key\_oplist.

Each parameter of the macro is expected to be an element of the variant.
Each element is defined by three parameters within parenthesis: 
the element name, the element type and the element oplist.
'name' and 'element' shall be a C identifier that will be used to identify the container.

This is like a C union. The main added value compared to using a union
is that it generates all the basic methods to handle it and it dynamically
identifies which element is stored within.

It shall be done once per type and per compilation unit.

The object oplist is expected to have at least the following operators (INIT\_SET, SET and CLEAR),
otherwise default operators are used. If there is no given oplist, the default oplist for standard C type is used
or a globally registered oplist is used.
The created methods will use the operators to init, set and clear the contained object.

Example:

	VARIANT_DEF2(either, (key, string_t, STRING_OPLIST),
			 (value, mpz_t, (INIT(mpz_init), INIT_SET(mpz_init_set), SET(mpz_set), CLEAR(mpz_clear) )))

		either_clear(p1);
	}

### M-BPTREE

A [B+TREE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree) is a variant of
[BTREE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree) that itself is
a generalization of [Binary Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree).

A B+TREE is an N-ary tree with a variable but often large number of children per node.
It is mostly used for handling slow media by file system and database.

It provides a fully sorted container enabling fast access to individual item
or range of items, and as such is concurrent to Red-Black Tree.
On modern architecture, a B+TREE is typically faster than a red-black tree due to being
more cache friendly (The RAM itself can be considered as a slow media nowadays!)

When defining a B+TREE it is necessary to give the type of the item within, but also
the maximum number of child per node. The best maximum number of child per node
depends on the type itself (its size, its compare cost) and the cache of the
processor. 

#### BPTREE\_DEF2(name, N, key_type, key_oplist, value, value_oplist)

Define the B+TREE tree of rank N 'name##\_t' and its associated methods as
"static inline" functions. This B+TREE will be created as an associative
array of the key_type to the value_type.

The CMP operator is used to perform the total ordering of the key elements.

It shall be done once per type and per compilation unit.
It also define the iterator name##\_it\_t and its associated methods as "static inline" functions.

The object oplist is expected to have at least the following operators (INIT, INIT\_SET, SET, CLEAR and CMP),
otherwise default operators are used. If there is no given oplist, the default oplist for standard C type is used
or a globally registered oplist is used.
The created methods will use the operators to init, set and clear the contained object.

Example:

	BPTREE_DEF2(tree_uint, unsigned int, (), float, ())
	void f(unsigned int num) {
		tree_uint_t tree;
		tree_uint_init(tree);
		for(unsigned int i = 0; i < num; i++)
			tree_uint_set_at(tree, i, (float) i);
		tree_uint_clear(tree);
	}

#### BPTREE\_OPLIST2(name, key_oplist, value_oplist)

Return the oplist of the BPTREE defined by calling BPTREE\_DEF2 with name, key_oplist
and value_oplist.

#### BPTREE\_DEF(name, N, key_type[, key_oplist])

Define the B+TREE tree of rank N 'name##\_t' and its associated methods as
"static inline" functions. This B+TREE will be created as an ordered set
of key_type.

The CMP operator is used to perform the total ordering of the key elements.

It shall be done once per type and per compilation unit.
It also define the iterator name##\_it\_t and its associated methods as "static inline" functions.

The object oplist is expected to have at least the following operators (INIT, INIT\_SET, SET, CLEAR and CMP),
otherwise default operators are used. If there is no given oplist, the default oplist for standard C type is used
or a globally registered oplist is used.
The created methods will use the operators to init, set and clear the contained object.

In the following specification, in this case, value\_type will be defined as the same
as key\_type.

Example:

	BPTREE_DEF(tree_uint, unsigned int)
	void f(unsigned int num) {
		tree_uint_t tree;
		tree_uint_init(tree);
		for(unsigned int i = 0; i < num; i++)
			tree_uint_push(tree, i);
		tree_uint_clear(tree);
	}

#### BPTREE\_OPLIST(name[, key_oplist])

Return the oplist of the BPTREE defined by calling BPTREE\_DEF with name, key_oplist.
If there is no given oplist, the default oplist for standard C type is used.


#### BPTREE\_MULTI\_DEF2(name, N, key_type, key_oplist, value, value_oplist)

Define the B+TREE tree of rank N 'name##\_t' and its associated methods as
"static inline" functions. This B+TREE will be created as an associative
array of the 'key_type' to the 'value_type' and allows multiple instance of
the same key in the tree (aka it is a multimap: re-adding the same key in
the tree will add a new instance of the key in the tree rather than update
the value associated to the key).

See BPTREE\_DEF2 for additional details and example.


#### BPTREE\_MULTI\_DEF(name, N, key_type[, key_oplist])

Define the B+TREE tree of rank N 'name##\_t' and its associated methods as
"static inline" functions. This B+TREE will be created as an ordered set
of key_type and allows multiple instance of
the same key in the tree (aka it is a multiset: re-adding the same key in
the tree will add a new instance of the key in the tree rather than update
the key value).

See BPTREE\_DEF for additional details and example.

### M-BUFFER

This header implements different kind of fixed circular buffer.

A [circular buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer) 
(or ring buffer) is a data structure using a single, bounded buffer
as if its head was connected to its tail.

#### BUFFER\_DEF(name, type, size, policy[, oplist])

Define the buffer 'name##\_t' and its associated methods as "static inline" functions.
A buffer is a fixed circular queue implementing a queue (or stack) interface.
It can be used to transfer message from multiple producer threads to multiple consumer threads.
This is done internally using a mutex and conditional waits
(if it is built with the BUFFER\_THREAD\_SAFE option -- default)

'name' shall be a C identifier that will be used to identify the container.

The size parameter defined the fixed size of the queue.
It can be 0. In this case, the fixed size is defined at initialization time only
and the needed objects to handle the buffer are allocated at initialization time too.
Otherwise the needed objects are embedded within the structure, preventing
any other allocations.

Multiple additional policy can be applied to the buffer by performing a logical or of the following properties:

* BUFFER\_QUEUE : define a FIFO queue (default),
* BUFFER\_STACK : define a stack (exclusive with BUFFER\_QUEUE),

* BUFFER\_THREAD\_SAFE : define thread safe functions (default),
* BUFFER\_THREAD\_UNSAFE : define thread unsafe functions (exclusive with BUFFER\_THREAD\_SAFE),

* BUFFER\_PUSH\_INIT\_POP\_MOVE : change the behavior of PUSH to push a new initialized object, and POP as moving this new object into the new emplacement (this is mostly used for performance reasons or to handle properly a shared_ptr semantic). In practice, it works as if POP performs the initialization of the object. 
* BUFFER\_PUSH\_OVERWRITE : PUSH overwrites the last entry if the queue is full instead of blocking,
* BUFFER\_DEFERRED\_POP : do not consider the object to be fully popped from the buffer by calling the pop method until the call to pop_deferred ; this enables to handle object that are in-progress of being consumed by the thread.

This container is designed to be used for easy synchronization inter-threads 
(and the variable shall be a global shared one).

It shall be done once per type and per compilation unit.

The object oplist is expected to have at least the following operators (INIT, INIT\_SET, SET and CLEAR),
otherwise default operators are used. If there is no given oplist, the default oplist for standard C type is used
or a globally registered oplist is used.
The created methods will use the operators to init, set and clear the contained object.
It supports also INIT\_MOVE if available.

Example:

	BUFFER_DEF(buffer_uint, unsigned int, 10, BUFFER_QUEUE|BUFFER_BLOCKING)

	buffer_uint_t g_buff;

	void f(unsigned int i) {
		buffer_uint_init(g_buff, 10);
		buffer_uint_push(g_buff, i);
		buffer_uint_pop(&i, g_buff);
		buffer_uint_clear(g_buff);
	}


#### Created methods

The following methods are automatically and properly created by the previous macros. In the following methods, name stands for the name given to the macro that is used to identify the type.

##### void name\_init(buffer\_t buffer, size\_t size)

Initialize the buffer 'buffer' for 'size' elements.
The 'size' argument shall be the same as the one used to create the buffer
or the one used to create the buffer was '0'.
This function is not thread safe.

This function is not thread safe and doesn't perform any synchronization:
all threads shall have stopped using the buffer.

this function returns the number of elements that have been overwritten
and thus discarded.
If the buffer was not built with the BUFFER\_PUSH\_OVERWRITE option,
it returns 0.

##### bool name\_push\_blocking(buffer\_t buffer, const type data, bool blocking)

Push the object 'data' in the buffer 'buffer',
waiting for an empty room if 'blocking' is true.

##### bool name\_pop\_blocking(type *data, buffer\_t buffer, bool blocking)

Pop from the buffer 'buffer' into the object '*data',
waiting for a data if 'blocking' is true.

If the buffer is built with the BUFFER\_PUSH\_INIT\_POP\_MOVE option,
the object pointed by 'data' shall be ***uninitialized***
as the pop function will perform a quick initialization of the object
(using an INIT_MOVE operator)
, otherwise it shall be an initialized object (the pop function will 
perform a SET operator).

If the buffer is built with the BUFFER\_DEFERRED\_POP option,
the object is still considered being present in the queue until
a call to name\_pop\_release.

Returns true if a data was popped, false otherwise.
Always return true if the buffer is blocking.
This function is thread safe if the buffer was built thread safe. 

##### bool name\_push(buffer\_t buffer, const type data)

Same as name\_push\_blocking with blocking equals to true.

##### bool name\_pop(type *data, buffer\_t buffer)

Same as name\_pop\_blocking with blocking equals to true.

##### bool name\_pop\_release(buffer\_t buffer)

If the buffer is built with the BUFFER\_DEFERRED\_POP option,

space in the queue).
Otherwise it does nothing.


#### QUEUE\_MPMC\_DEF(name, type, policy[, oplist])

Define the MPMC queue 'name##\_t' and its associated methods as "static inline" functions.

In practice, it works as if POP performs the initialization of the object. 

This container is designed to be used for easy synchronization inter-threads
in a context of very fast communication.
(the variable shall be a global shared one).

It shall be done once per type and per compilation unit.

The object oplist is expected to have at least the following operators (INIT, INIT\_SET, SET and CLEAR),

This function is thread safe. 



#### QUEUE\_SPSC\_DEF(name, type, policy[, oplist])

It is more specialized than QUEUE\_MPMC\_DEF and as such, is faster.

The size is specified only at run-time and shall be a power of 2.

'name' shall be a C identifier that will be used to identify the container.

An additional policy can be applied to the buffer by performing a logical or of the following properties:

In practice, it works as if POP performs the initialization of the object. 

This container is designed to be used for easy synchronization inter-threads
in a context of very fast communication (the variable shall be a global shared one).

It shall be done once per type and per compilation unit.

### M-SNAPSHOT

This header is for created snapshots.

A snapshot is a mechanism enabling a reader thread and a writer thread,
 **working at different speeds**, to exchange messages in a fast, reliable and thread safe way
(the message is always passed automatically from a thread point of view) without waiting
for synchronization.
The consumer thread has only access to the latest published data of 
the producer thread.
This is implemented in a fast way as the writer directly writes the message in the buffer
that will be passed to the reader (avoiding copy of the buffer) and a simple exchange
of index is sufficient to handle the switch.

This container is designed to be used for easy synchronization inter-threads 
(and the variable shall be a global shared one).

This is linked to [shared atomic register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_register) in the literature 
and [snapshot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_snapshot_objects) names vector of such registers
where each element of the vector can be updated separately. They can be classified according to the
number of producers/consumers:
SPSC (Single Producer, Single Consumer),
MPSC (Multiple Producer, Single Consumer),
SPMC (Single Producer, Multiple Consumer),
MPMC (Multiple Producer, Multiple Consumer),

The provided containers by the library are designed to handle huge
structure efficiently and as such deal with the memory reclamation needed to handle them.
If the data you are sharing are supported by the atomic header (like bool or integer), 
using atomic_load and atomic_store is a much more efficient and simple way to do
even in the case of MPMC.


#### SNAPSHOT\_SPSC\_DEF(name, type[, oplist])

Define the snapshot 'name##\_t' and its associated methods as "static inline" functions.
Only a single reader thread and a single writer thread are supported.
It is a SPSC atomic shared register.
In practice, it is implemented using a triple buffer (lock-free).

It shall be done once per type and per compilation unit. Not all functions are thread safe.

The object oplist is expected to have at least the following operators (INIT, INIT\_SET, SET and CLEAR),
otherwise default operators are used. If there is no given oplist, the default oplist for standard C type is used
or a globally registered oplist is used.
The created methods will use the operators to init, set and clear the contained object.
It supports also INIT\_MOVE if available.

Example:

	SNAPSHOT_DEF(snapshot_uint, unsigned int)
	snapshot_uint_t message;
	void f(unsigned int i) {
		unsigned *p = snapshot_uint_get_write_buffer(message);
		*p = i;
                snapshot_uint_write(message);
	}
	unsigned int g(void) {
		unsigned *p = snapshot_uint_read(message);
		return *p;
	}

TODO: Document SPMC & MPMC snapshots


### M-SHARED

This header is for creating shared pointer.
A [shared pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_pointer)
 is a smart pointer that retains shared ownership of an object.
Several shared pointers may own the same object, sharing ownership of an object. 


#### SHARED\_PTR\_DEF(name, type[, oplist])

Define the shared pointer 'name##\_t' and its associated methods as "static inline" functions.
A shared pointer is a mechanism to keep tracks of all users of an object
and performs an automatic destruction of the object whenever all users release
their need on this object.

The tracking of ownership is atomic and the destruction of the object is thread safe.

The object oplist is expected to have at least the following operators (CLEAR to clear the object and DEL to free the allocated memory),
otherwise default operators are used. If there is no given oplist, the default oplist for standard C type is used
or a globally registered oplist is used.
The created methods will use the operators to initialize, set and clear the contained object.
It supports also the INIT\_MOVE operator of the object if available.


There are designed to work with buffers with policy BUFFER\_PUSH\_INIT\_POP\_MOVE
to send a shared pointer across multiple threads.

Example:

	SHARED_PTR_DEF(shared_mpz, mpz_t, (CLEAR(mpz_clear)))
	void f(void) {
		shared_mpz_t p;
		mpz_t z;
		mpz_init(z);
		shared_mpz_init2 (p, z);
		buffer_uint_push(g_buff1, p);
		buffer_uint_push(g_buff2, p);
		shared_mpz_clear(p);
	}


#### Created methods

The following methods are automatically and properly created by the previous macros. In the following methods, name stands for the name given to the macro that is used to identify the type.

##### void name\_init(shared\_t shared)

Initialize the shared pointer 'shared' to represent NULL
(no object is therefore referenced).

##### void name\_init2(shared\_t shared, type *data)

Initialize the shared pointer 'shared' to reference '*data'.
User code shall not use '*data' (or any pointer to it) anymore
as the shared pointer gets the exclusive ownership of the object.

##### void name\_init\_new(shared\_t shared)

Initialize the shared pointer 'shared' to a new object of type 'type'.
The default constructor of type is used to initialize the object.

##### void name\_init\_set(shared\_t shared, const shared\_t src)

Initialize the shared pointer 'shared' to the same object than the one
pointed by 'src' (sharing ownership).
This function is thread safe from 'src' point of view.

##### bool name\_NULL\_p(const shared\_t shared)

Return true if shared doesn't reference any object.

##### void name\_clear(shared\_t shared)

Clear the shared pointer:
the shared pointer loses its ownership of the object and
it destroys it if no longer any other shared pointers own the object.
This function is thread safe.

##### void name\_clean(shared\_t shared)

'shared' loses ownership of its object and destroy it
if no longer any other shared pointers own it.
Then it makes the shared pointer 'shared' references NULL
(it doesn't reference its object any-longer and loses its ownership of it).
This function is thread safe.

##### void name\_set(shared\_t shared, const shared\_t src)

'shared' loses ownership of its object and destroy it
if no longer any other shared pointers own it.
Then it sets the shared pointer 'shared' to the same object 
than the one pointed by 'src' (sharing ownership).
This function is thread safe.

##### void name\_init\_move(shared\_t shared, shared\_t src)

Move the shared pointer from the initialized 'src' to 'shared'.

##### void name\_move(shared\_t shared, shared\_t src)

'shared' loses ownership of its object and destroy it
if no longer any other shared pointers own it.
Then it moves the shared pointer from the initialized 'src' to 'shared'.

##### void name\_swap(shared\_t shared1, shared\_t shared2)

Swap the references of the objects owned by the shared pointers 'shared1' and 'shared2'.

##### bool name\_equal\_p(const shared\_t shared1, const shared\_t shared2)

Return true if both shared pointers own the same object.

##### const type *name\_cref(const shared\_t shared)

Return a constant pointer to the shared object owned by the shared pointer.
The pointer shall be kept only until another use of shared pointer method.
Keeping the pointer otherwise is undefined behavior.

Return a pointer to the shared object pointed by the shared pointer.
The pointer shall be kept only until another use of shared pointer method.
Keeping the pointer otherwise is undefined behavior.

TODO: Document shared resource



### M-I-SHARED

This header is for creating intrusive shared pointer.

#### ISHARED\_INTERFACE(name, type)

Extend the definition of the structure of an object of type 'type' by adding the
necessary interface to handle it as a shared pointer named 'name'.
It shall be put within the structure definition of the object (See example).

#### ISHARED\_PTR\_DEF(name, type[, oplist])

Define the associated methods to handle the shared pointer named 'name'
as "static inline" functions.
A shared pointer is a mechanism to keep tracks of all users of an object
and performs an automatic destruction of the object whenever all users release
their need on this object.

The destruction of the object is thread safe and to occur when all users
of the object release it. The last user that releases it is the one that
performs the destruction of the object. The destruction of the object implies:

* calling the CLEAR operator to clear the object,
* calling the DEL operator to release the memory used by the object 
(if the method has not been disabled).

The object oplist is expected to have the following operators (CLEAR and DEL),
otherwise default operators are used. If there is no given oplist, the default
operators are also used. The created methods will use the operators to init, set
and clear the contained object.

There are designed to work with buffers with policy BUFFER\_PUSH\_INIT\_POP\_MOVE
to send a shared pointer across multiple threads.

It is recommended to use the intrusive shared pointer over the standard one if
possible (They are faster & cleaner).

Example:

        typedef struct mystruct_s {
                ISHARED_PTR_INTERFACE(ishared_mystruct, struct mystruct_s);
                char *message;
        } mystruct_t;

        static inline void mystruct_clear(mystruct_t *p) { free(p->message); }

        ISHARED_PTR_DEF(ishared_mystruct, mystruct_t, (CLEAR(mystruct_clear M_IPTR)))

        void f(void) {
                mystruct_t *p = ishared_mystruct_new();
                p->message = strdup ("Hello");
                buffer_mystruct_push(g_buff1, p);
                buffer_mystruct_push(g_buff2, p);
                ishared_mystruct_clear(p);
        }


#### Created methods

The following methods are automatically and properly created by the previous macros. In the following methods, name stands for the name given to the macro that is used to identify the type.

##### typedef type *name_t

It will define name_t as a pointer to shared counted object.
This is a synonymous to a pointer to the object.

##### name_t name\_init(type *object)

Return a shared pointer to 'object' which owns 'object'.
The shared pointer part of 'object' shall not have been initialized,
whereas other part of the object shall be initialized.

##### name_t name\_init\_set(name_t shared)

Return a new shared pointer to the same object than the one pointed by 'shared',
incrementing the ownership of the object.
This function is thread safe.

##### void name\_init\_set2(name_t *ptr, name_t shared)

Set '*ptr' to a new shared pointer to 'shared', 
incrementing the ownership of the object referenced by 'shared'.
This function is thread safe (providing the ptr address is local to a thread).

##### name_t name\_init\_new(void)

Allocate a new object, initialize it and return an initialized shared pointer to it.

The used allocation function is the ALLOC operator.
In this case, it is assumed that the DEL operator has not been disabled.


##### void name\_clear(name_t shared)

Clear the shared pointer, releasing ownership of the object
and destroying the shared object if no longer
any other shared pointers own it.
This function is thread safe.

##### void name\_set(name_t *shared1, name_t shared2)

Update the shared pointer '*shared1' to point to the same object than
the shared pointer 'shared2'.
Destroy the shared object pointed by '*shared1' if no longer any other shared
pointers own it, set the shared pointer 'shared' to the same object 
than the one pointed by 'src'.
This function is thread safe.



### M-I-LIST

This header is for creating intrusive doubly-linked list.

#### ILIST\_INTERFACE(name, type)

Extend an object by adding the necessary interface to handle it within 
an intrusive doubly-linked list.
This is the intrusive part.
It shall be put within the structure of the object to link, at the top
level of the structure.
See example of ILIST\_DEF.

#### ILIST\_DEF(name, type[, oplist])

Define the intrusive doubly-linked list 
and define the associated methods to handle it as "static inline" functions.
'name' shall be a C identifier that will be used to identify the list. It will be used to create all the types and functions to handle the container.
It shall be done once per type and per compilation unit.

An object is expected to be part of only one list of a kind in the entire program at a time.
An intrusive list enables to move from an object to the next object without needing to go through the entire list,
or to remove an object from a list in O(1).
It may, or may not, be better than standard list. It depends on the context.

The object oplist is expected to have the default operators. If there is no given oplist, the methods for a standard C type are used, or if there is a global defined oplist, it is used.
The created methods will use the operators to init, set and clear the contained object.

The given interface won't allocate anything to handle the objects as
all allocations and initialization are let to the user.

However the objects within the list can be automatically be cleared
(by calling the CLEAR method to destruct the object) on list destruction.
The memory allocation, performed by the called, can also be reclaimed
by defining a DEL operator to free the used memory in the object oplist.
If there is no DEL operator, it is up to the user to free the used memory.

Example:

	typedef struct test_s {
	  int n;
	  ILIST_INTERFACE (ilist_tname, struct test_s);
	} test_t;

	ILIST_DEF(ilist_tname, test_t)

	void f(void) {
		test_t x1, x2, x3;
		ilist_tname_t list;

		x1.n = 1;
		x2.n = 2;
		x3.n = 3;

		ilist_tname_init(list);
		ilist_tname_push_back (list, &x3);
		ilist_tname_push_front (list, &x1);
		ilist_tname_push_after (&x1, &x2);

		int n = 1;
		for M_EACH(item, list, ILIST_OPLIST(ilist_tname)) {
			assert (n == item->n);
			n++;
		}
		ilist_tname_clear(list);
	}

### M-CONCURRENT

This header is for transforming a standard container (LIST, ARRAY, DICT, DEQUE, ...)
into an equivalent container but compatible with concurrent access by different threads. 
In practice, it puts a lock to access the container.

As such it is quite generic. However it is less efficient than containers
specially tuned for multiple threads.
There is also no iterators.

#### methods

#### CONCURRENT\_DEF(name, type[, oplist])

Define the concurrent container 'name' based on container 'type' of oplist 'oplist',
and define the associated methods to handle it as "static inline" functions.
'name' shall be a C identifier that will be used to identify the list. 
It will be used to create all the types and functions to handle the container.
It shall be done once per type and per compilation unit.

It scans the 'oplist' of the type to create equivalent function,
so it needs it (either explictly or implictly).

Example:

        /* Define a stack container (STACK)*/
        ARRAY_DEF(array1, int)
        CONCURRENT_DEF(parray1, array1_t, ARRAY_OPLIST(array1))

        /* Define a queue container (FIFO) */
        DEQUE_DEF(deque_uint, unsigned int)
        CONCURRENT_DEF(cdeque_uint, deque_uint_t, M_OPEXTEND(DEQUE_OPLIST(deque_uint, M_DEFAULT_OPLIST), PUSH(deque_uint_push_front)))

	extern parray1_t x1;
	extern cdeque_uint_t x2;

	void f(void) {
	     parray1_push (x1, 17);
	     cdeque_uint_push (x2, 17);
	}

### M-CORE

This header is the internal core of M\*LIB, providing a lot of functionality 
by extending a lot the preprocessing capability.
Working with these macros is not easy and the developer needs to know
how the macro preprocessing works.
It also adds the needed macro for handling the oplist.
As a consequence, it is needed by all other header files.

Some macros are using recursivity to work.
This is not an easy feat to do as it needs some tricks to work (see
reference).
This still work well with only one major limitation: it can not be chained.
For example, if MACRO is a macro implementing recursivity, then
MACRO(MACRO()) won't work.


Example:

	M_MAP(f, 1, 2, 3, 4)
	M_REDUCE(f, g, 1, 2, 3, 4)
	M_SEQ(1, 20, f)

wrapper around it).

##### M\_PRINT(args...)

Print using printf all the variable in 'args'. 
The format of the arguments are deduced provided that it is a standard numerical C type.

expression even if the case if always false, and is not executed.
This can seriously limit the _Generic statement.
This macro overcomes this limitation by returning :

* either the input 'x' if it is of type 'type',
* or the value 0 view as a type 'type'.

Check if a a symbol composed of M_OPL_##a() is defined as an oplist, and returns its
name otherwise return a name that will expand to M_DEFAULT_OPLIST.
The return value shall be evaluated once again to get the oplist
(this is needed due to technical reasons).

    M_GLOBAL_OPLIST_OR_DEF(mpz_t)()

In short, if a global oplist is defined for the argument, it returns it
otherwise it returns the default oplist.
Global oplist is limited to typedef types.
       

#### Syntax enhancing

These macros are quite useful to lighten the C style and make full use of the library.

##### M\_EACH(item, container, oplist|type)

This macro iterates over the given 'container' of oplist 'oplist'
(or of type 'type' with a globally registered oplist) and sets 'item' 
to reference one different element of the container for each iteration of
the loop.

'item' is a created pointer variable to the contained type
of the container, only available within the 'for' loop.
There can only have one M\_EACH per line.
It shall be used after the for C keyword to perform a loop over the container.
The order of the iteration depends on the given container.

Example: 
         for M_EACH(item, list, LIST_OPLIST) { action; }

##### M\_LET(var1[,var2[,...]], oplist|type)

This macro defines the variable 'var1'(resp. var2, ...) 
of oplist 'oplist' (or of type 'type' with a globally registered oplist). 
It initializes 'var1' (resp. var2, ...) by calling the initialization method,
and clears 'var1' (resp. var2, ...) by calling the clear method
when the bracket associated to the M\_LET go out of scope.

If 'var1' (resp. var2, ...) has the form (v1, va_list...),
then the variable 'v1' will be initialized with the 
contains of 'va_list...' using the specialized initializer operator INIT\_WITH
and not the empty initializer INIT operator.

Example:

     M_LET(a, STRING_OPLIST) { do something with a }  or
     M_LET(a, b, c, STRING_OPLIST) { do something with a, b & c }

NOTE: The user code can not perform a return or a goto outside the {}
otherwise the clear code of the object won't be called .
However, you can use the break instruction to quit the block.


#### Memory macros

All these macro can be overridden before including the header m-core.h
so that they can be adapted to a particular memory pool.


##### type *M\_MEMORY\_ALLOC (type)

Return a pointer to a new allocated non-initialized object of type 'type'.
In case of allocation error, it returns NULL.
The default used function is the 'malloc' function of the LIBC.


##### void M\_MEMORY\_DEL (type *ptr)

Delete the cleared object pointed by the pointer 'ptr'
that was previously allocated by the macro M\_MEMORY\_ALLOC.
'ptr' can not be NULL.
The default used function is the 'free' function of the LIBC.


##### type *M\_MEMORY\_REALLOC (type, ptr, number)

Return a pointer to an array of 'number' objects of type 'type'
'ptr' is either NULL (in which the array is allocated), 
or a pointer returned from a previous call of M\_MEMORY\_REALLOC 
(in which case the array is reallocated).
The objects are not initialized, nor the state of previous objects changed
(in case of reallocation).
The address of the previous objects may have moved and the MOVE operator
is not used in this case.
In case of allocation error, it returns NULL.
The default used function is the 'realloc' function of the LIBC.


##### void M\_MEMORY\_FREE (type *ptr)

Delete the cleared object pointed by the pointer 'ptr'.
The pointer was previously allocated by the macro M\_MEMORY\_REALLOC.
'ptr' can not be NULL.
The default used function is the 'free' function of the LIBC.


##### void M\_MEMORY\_FULL (size_t size)

This macro is called when a memory error has been detected and shall be raised.
The parameter 'size' is what was tried to be allocated.
The default is to abort the execution.
The macro can :

* abort the execution,
* throw an exception (In this case, the state of the object is unchanged),
* set a global error variable and return.

NOTE: The last two cases are not properly fully supported yet.
Throwing an exception is not fully supported yet.


##### void M\_ASSERT\_INIT\_FAILURE(expression, object_name)

This macro is called when an assertion used in an initialization context
is called to check the good creation of an object (like a thread, a mutex)
that string name is 'object_name'. 
If the given 'expression' is false, the execution shall be aborted.
The assertion is kept in programs built in release mode.
The default is to abort the execution.


#### Generic Serialization objects.

A [serialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization) is the process of translating
data structures into a format that can be stored or transmitted.
When the resulting format is reread and translated, 
it creates a semantically identical clone of the original object. 

A generic serialization object is an object that takes a C object (boolean, integer, float, 
structure, union, pointer, array, list, hashmap, ...) and outputs it into a serialization way through
the following defined interface that defined the format of the serialization and where it is 
physically output. 

The M\*LIB containers define the methods \_out\_serial and \_in\_serial
if the underlying types define theses methods over the operators OUT\_SERIAL and IN\_SERIAL.
The methods for the basic C types (int, float, ...) are also defined (but only
in C11 due to technical limitation).

The methods \_out\_serial and \_in\_serial will request the generic serialization object
to serialize their current object:

* calling the interface of the generic serialization object if needed, 
* performing recursive call to serialize the contained-objects.

The final output of this serialization can be a FILE or a string.
Two kinds of serialization objects exist: one for input and one
for output. The serialization is fully recursive and can be seen as a collection of token.
The only constraint is that what is output by the output serialization object
shall be able to be parsed by the input serialization object.


The serialization input object is named as m\_serial\_read\_t, defined in m-core.h as a structure
(of array of size 1) with the following fields:

* m\_interface: a pointer to the constant m\_serial\_read\_interface\_s structure that defines all
methods that operate on this object to parse it. The instance has to be customized for the needs of the
wanted serialization.
* data: a table of M\_SERIAL\_MAX\_DATA\_SIZE of C types (boolean, integer, size or pointer).
This data is used to store the needed data for the methods.

This is pretty much like a pure virtual interface object in C++. The interface has to defines
the following fields with the following definition:

*  read\_boolean: 
   Read from the stream 'serial' a boolean. 
   Set '*b' with the boolean value if it succeeds.
   Return M\_SERIAL\_OK\_DONE if it succeeds, M\_SERIAL\_FAIL otherwise
* read\_integer:
   Read from the stream 'serial' an integer that can be represented with 'size_of_type' bytes.
   Set '*i' with the integer value if it succeeds. 
   Return M\_SERIAL\_OK\_DONE if it succeeds, M\_SERIAL\_FAIL otherwise.
* read\_float:
   Read from the stream 'serial' a float that can be represented with 'size_of_type' bytes.
   Set '*r' with the float value if it succeeds. 
   Return M\_SERIAL\_OK\_DONE if it succeeds, M\_SERIAL\_FAIL otherwise.
* read\_string:
   Read from the stream 'serial' a string.
   Set 's' with the string if it succeeds. 
   Return M\_SERIAL\_OK\_DONE if it succeeds, M\_SERIAL\_FAIL otherwise
* read\_array\_start:
   Start reading from the stream 'serial' an array (which is defined as a sequential collection of object).
   Set '*num' with the number of elements, or 0 if it is not known.
   Initialize the object 'local' so that it can be used by the serialization object to serialize the array. 
   ('local' is an unique local serialization object of the array).
   Return M\_SERIAL\_OK\_CONTINUE if it succeeds and the parsing of the array can continue (the array is not empty),
   M\_SERIAL\_OK\_DONE if it succeeds and the array ends (the array is empty),
   M\_SERIAL\_FAIL otherwise.
* read\_array\_next:
   Continue reading from the stream 'serial' an array using 'local' to load / save data if needed.
   Return M\_SERIAL\_OK\_CONTINUE if it succeeds and the array can continue (the array end is still not reached),
   M\_SERIAL\_OK\_DONE if it succeeds and the array ends,
   M\_SERIAL\_FAIL otherwise.
* read\_map_start:
   Start reading from the stream 'serial' a map (an associative array).
   Set '*num' with the number of elements, or 0 if it is not known.
   Initialize 'local' so that it can be used to serialize the map. 
   ('local' is an unique serialization object of the map).
   Return M\_SERIAL\_OK\_CONTINUE if it succeeds and the map continue,
   M\_SERIAL\_OK\_DONE if it succeeds and the map ends (the map is empty),
   M\_SERIAL\_FAIL otherwise
* read\_map\_value:
   Continue reading from the stream 'serial' the value separator token (if needed)
   using 'local' to load / save data if needed.
   Return M\_SERIAL\_OK\_CONTINUE if it succeeds and the map continue,
   M\_SERIAL\_FAIL otherwise
* read\_map_next:
   Continue reading from the stream 'serial' a map.
   using 'local' to load / save data if needed.
   Return M\_SERIAL\_OK\_CONTINUE if it succeeds and the map continue,
   M\_SERIAL\_OK\_DONE if it succeeds and the map ends,
   M\_SERIAL\_FAIL otherwise
* read\_tuple\_start:
   Start reading a tuple from the stream 'serial'.
   Return M\_SERIAL\_OK\_CONTINUE if it succeeds and the tuple continues,
   M\_SERIAL\_FAIL otherwise
* read\_tuple\_id:
   Continue reading a tuple (a structure) from the stream 'serial'.
   using 'local' to load / save data if needed.
   Set '*id' with the corresponding index of the table 'field_name[max]'
   associated to the parsed field in the stream.
   Return M\_SERIAL\_OK\_CONTINUE if it succeeds and the tuple continues,
   Return M\_SERIAL\_OK\_DONE if it succeeds and the tuple ends,
   M\_SERIAL\_FAIL otherwise
* read\_variant\_start:
   Start reading a variant (an union) from the stream 'serial'.
   Set '*id' with the corresponding index of the table 'field_name[max]'
   associated to the parsed field in the stream.
   Return M\_SERIAL\_OK\_CONTINUE if it succeeds and the variant continues,
   Return M\_SERIAL\_OK\_DONE if it succeeds and the variant ends(variant is empty),
   M\_SERIAL\_FAIL otherwise
* read\_variant\_end:
   End reading a variant from the stream 'serial'.
   Return M\_SERIAL\_OK\_DONE if it succeeds and the variant ends,
   M\_SERIAL\_FAIL otherwise

The serialization output object is named as m\_serial\_write\_t, defined in m-core.h as a structure
(of array of size 1) with the following fields:

* m\_interface: a pointer to the constant m\_serial\_write\_interface\_s structure that defines all
methods that operate on this object to output it. The instance has to be customized for the needs of the
wanted serialization.
* data: a table of M\_SERIAL\_MAX\_DATA\_SIZE of C types (boolean, integer, size or pointer).
This data is used to store the needed data for the methods.

This is pretty much like a pure virtual interface object in C++. The interface has to defines
the following fields with the following definition:

   Write the boolean 'b' into the serial stream 'serial'.
   Return M\_SERIAL\_OK\_DONE if it succeeds, M\_SERIAL\_FAIL otherwise */

* write\_array\_start:

   If 'number_of_elements' is 0, then either the array has no data,
   or the number of elements of the array is unknown.
   Initialize 'local' so that it can be used to serialize the array 
   (local is an unique serialization object of the array).
   Return M\_SERIAL\_OK\_CONTINUE if it succeeds, M\_SERIAL\_FAIL otherwise */
* write\_array\_next:
   Write an array separator between elements of an array into the serial stream 'serial' if needed.

   End the writing of an array into the serial stream 'serial'.
   Return M\_SERIAL\_OK\_DONE if it succeeds, M\_SERIAL\_FAIL otherwise */
* write\_map\_start:
   Start writing a map of 'number_of_elements' pairs of objects into the serial stream 'serial'.
   If 'number_of_elements' is 0, then either the map has no data,
   or the number of elements is unknown.
   Initialize 'local' so that it can be used to serialize the map 
   (local is an unique serialization object of the map).

M\_SERIAL\_MAX\_DATA\_SIZE can be overloaded before including any M\*LIB header
to increase the size of the generic object. The maximum default size is 4 fields.

See [m-serial-json.h](#m-serial-json) for example of use.


### M-MUTEX

This header is for providing very thin layer around OS implementation of threads, conditional variables and mutex.
It has back-ends for WIN32, POSIX thread or C11 thread.

It was needed due to the low adoption rate of the C11 equivalent layer.

Example:

	m_thread_t idx_p;
	m_thread_t idx_c;

	m_thread_create (idx_p, conso_function, NULL);
	m_thread_create (idx_c, prod_function, NULL);
	m_thread_join (idx_p;
	m_thread_join (idx_c);

#### Attributes

The following attributes are available:

##### M\_THREAD\_ATTR

An attribute used for qualifying a variable to be thread specific.
It is an alias for \_\_thread, \_Thread\_local or \_\_declspec( thread )
depending on the used backend.


#### methods

The following methods are available:

##### m\_mutex\_t

A type representing a mutex.

##### void m\_mutex\_init(mutex)

Initialize the variable mutex of type m\_mutex\_t. 
If the initialization fails, the program aborts.

##### void m\_mutex\_clear(mutex)

Clear the variable mutex of type m\_mutex\_t. 
If the variable is not initialized, the behavior is undefined.

##### void m\_mutex\_lock(mutex)

Lock the variable mutex of type m\_mutex\_t for exclusive use.
If the variable is not free, it will wait indefinitely until it is.
If the variable is not initialized, the behavior is undefined.

##### void m\_mutex\_unlock(mutex)

Unlock the variable mutex of type m\_mutex\_t for exclusive use.
If the variable is not locked, the behavior is undefined.
If the variable is not initialized, the behavior is undefined.

##### M\_LOCK\_DECL(name)

Define the lock 'name'. This shall be called in the global space (reserved for global variables).

##### M\_LOCK(name)

Use the lock 'name': the encapsulation instructions are protected by the lock.
Example:

        M_LOCK_DECL(n_lock);
        unsigned long n = 0;
        void f(void) {
             M_LOCK(n_lock) {
               n ++;
             }
        }

#### m\_cond\_t

A type representing a conditional variable, used within a mutex section.

##### void m\_cond\_init(m\_cond\_t cond)

Initialize the conditional variable cond of type m\_cond\_t. 
If the initialization failed, the program aborts.

##### void m\_cond\_clear(m\_cond\_t cond)

Clear the variable cond of type m\_cond\_t. 
If the variable is not initialized, the behavior is undefined.

##### void m\_cond\_signal(m\_cond\_t cond)

Within a mutex exclusive section,
signal that the event associated to the variable cond of type m\_cond\_t 
has occurred to at least a single thread.
If the variable is not initialized, the behavior is undefined.

##### void m\_cond\_broadcast(m\_cond\_t cond)

Within a mutex exclusive section,
signal that the event associated to the variable cond of type m\_cond\_t 
has occurred to all waiting threads.
If the variable is not initialized, the behavior is undefined.

##### void m\_cond\_wait(m\_cond\_t cond, m\_mutex\_t mutex)

Within a mutex exclusive section defined by mutex,
wait indefinitely for the event associated to the variable cond of type m\_cond\_t
to occur.
IF multiple threads wait for the same event, which thread to awoken
is not specified.
If any variable is not initialized, the behavior is undefined.

#### m\_thread\_t

A type representing an id of a thread.

##### void m\_thread\_create(m\_thread\_t thread, void (\*function)(void\*), void \*argument)

Create a new thread and set the it of the thread to 'thread'.
The new thread run the code function(argument) with
argument a 'void \*' and function taking a 'void \*' and returning
nothing.
If the initialization fails, the program aborts.

##### void m\_thread\_join(m\_thread\_t thread)

Wait indefinitely for the thread 'thread' to exit.


### M-WORKER

This header is for providing a pool of workers.
Each worker run in a separate thread and can handle work orders
sent by the main threads. A work order is a computation task.
Work orders are organized around synchronization points.
Workers can be disabled globaly to ease debugging.

This implements parallelism just like OpenMP or CILK++.

Example:

        worker_t worker;
        worker_init(worker, 0, 0, NULL);
        worker_sync_t sync;
        worker_start(sync, worker);
        void *data = ...;
        worker_spawn (sync, taskFunc, data);
        taskFunc(otherData);
        worker_sync(sync);
        

Currently, there is no support for:

* throw exceptions by the worker tasks,
* unbalanced design: the worker tasks shall not lock a mutex without closing it (same for other synchronization structures).

Thread Local Storage variables have to be reinitialized properly
with the reset function. This may result in subtle difference between the
serial code and the parallel code.

#### Global Conditional Code

##### M\_USE\_WORKER

This macro indicates if the multi-thread code shall be used (=1) or not (=0).
It can be overloaded by the user code before including any headers of M\*LIB.
If it is not defined, the default is to use the multi-thread code.

#### methods

The following methods are available:

#### worker\_t

A pool of worker.

#### worker\_sync\_t

A synchronization point between workers.

#### void worker\_init(worker\_t worker[, unsigned int numWorker, unsigned int extraQueue, void (*resetFunc)(void), void (*clearFunc)(void) ])

Initialize the pool of workers 'worker' with 'numWorker' workers.
if 'numWorker' is 0, then it will detect how many core is available on the
system and creates as much workers as there are cores.

Before starting any work, the function 'resetFunc'
is called by the worker to reset its state (or call nothing if the function
pointer is NULL).

'extraQueue' is the number of tasks that can be accepted by the work order
queue in case if there is no worker available.

Before terminating, each worker will call 'clearFunc' if the function is not NULL.

Default values are respectively 0, 0, NULL and NULL.

#### void worker\_clear(worker\_t worker)

Request terminaison to the pool of workers, and wait for them to terminate.
It is undefined if there is any work order in progress.

#### void worker\_start(worker\_block\_t syncBlock, worker\_t worker)

Start a new synchronization block for a pool of work orders
linked to the pool of worker 'worker'.

#### void worker\_spawn(worker\_block\_t syncBlock, void (*func)(void *data), void *data)

Register the work order 'func(data)' to the the synchronization point 'syncBlock'.
If no worker is available (and no extraQueue), the work order 'func(data)' will be handled
by the caller. Otherwise the work order 'func(data)' will be handled
by an asynchronous worker and the function immediately returns.

#### bool worker\_sync\_p(worker\_block\_t syncBlock)

Test if all work orders registered to this synchronization point are
terminated (true) or not (false). 

#### void worker\_sync(worker\_block\_t syncBlock)

Wait for all work orders registered to this synchronization point 'syncBlock'
to be terminated.

#### size\_t worker\_count(worker\_t worker)

Return the number of workers of the pool.


#### WORKER\_SPAWN(syncBlock, input, core, output)

Request the work order 'core' to the synchronization point syncBlock.
If no worker is available (and no extra queue), the work order 'core' will be handled
by the caller. Otherwise the work order 'core' will be handled
by an asynchronous worker.

'core' is any C code that doesn't break the control flow (you
cannot use return / goto / break to go outside the flow).
'input' is the list of local input variables of the 'core' block within "( )".
'output' is the list of local output variables of the 'core' block within "( )".
These lists shall be exhaustive to capture all needed variables.

This macro needs either GCC (for nested function) or CLANG (for blocks)
or a C++11 compiler (for lambda and functional) to work.

NOTE1: Even if nested functions are used for GCC, it doesn't generate
a trampoline and the stack doesn't need to be executable as all variables are captured by the library.

NOTE2: For CLANG, you need to add -fblocks to CFLAGS and -lBlocksRuntime to LIB (See CLANG manual).

NOTE3: It will generate warnings about shadowed variables. There is no way to avoid this.

NOTE4: arrays and not trivially movable object are not supported as input / output variables due to 
current technical limitations.


### M-ATOMIC

This header goal is to provide the C header 'stdatomic.h'
to any C compiler (C11 or C99 compliant) or C++ compiler.
If available, it uses the C11 header stdatomic.h,
otherwise if the compiler is a C++ compiler,
it uses the header 'atomic' and imports all definition
into the global namespace (this is needed because the
C++ standard doesn't support officially the stdatomic header,
resulting in broken compilation when building C code with
a C++ compiler).
Otherwise it provides a non-thin emulation of atomic
using mutex.


### M-ALGO

This header is for generating generic algorithm to containers.

#### ALGO\_DEF(name, container_oplist)

Define the available algorithms for the container which oplist is container_oplist.
The defined algorithms depend on the availability of the methods of the containers
(For example, if there no CMP operator, there is no MIN method defined).

Example:

	ARRAY_DEF(array_int, int)
	ALGO_DEF(array_int, ARRAY_OPLIST(int))
	void f(void) {
		array_int_t l;
		array_int_init(l);
		for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
			array_int_push_back (l, i);
		array_int_push_back (l, 17);
		assert( array_int_contains(l, 62) == true);
		assert( array_int_contains(l, -1) == false);
		assert( array_int_count(l, 17) == 2);
		array_int_clear(l);
	}

into a single element by applying the reduce function:

     dest = reduceFunc(mapFunc(item[0]), reduceFunc(..., reduceFunc(mapFunc(item[N-2]), mapFunc(item[N-1]))))


'mapFunc' is a method which prototype is:
    
    void mapFunc(dest, item)

with both 'dest' & 'item' that are of the same type than the one of
the container. It transforms the 'item' into another form that is suitable
for the 'reduceFunc'.
If 'mapFunc' is not specified, identity will be used instead.

'reduceFunc' is a method which prototype is:
 
     void reduceFunc(dest, item)

It integrates the new 'item' into the partial 'sum' 'dest.

The reduce function can be the special keywords 'add', 'sum', 'and', 'or'

of container 'contSrc'.



### M-MEMPOOL

This header is for generating specialized and optimized memory pools:
it will generate specialized functions to allocate and free only one kind of an object.
The mempool functions are not specially thread safe for a given mempool,
but the mempool variable can have the attribute M\_THREAD\_ATTR
so that each thread has its own instance of the mempool.

The memory pool has to be initialized and cleared like any other variable.
Clearing the memory pool will free all the memory that has been allocated 
within this memory pool.


#### MEMPOOL\_DEF(name, type)

Generate specialized functions & types prefixed by 'name' to alloc & free an object of type 'type'.

Example:

	MEMPOOL_DEF(mempool_uint, unsigned int)

        mempool_uint_t m;

	void f(void) {
          mempool_uint_init(m);
          unsigned int *p = mempool_uint_alloc(m);
          *p = 17;
          mempool_uint_free(m, p);
          mempool_uint_clear(m);
        }

#### Created methods

The following methods are automatically and properly created by the previous macros. In the following methods, name stands for the name given to the macro that is used to identify the type.

##### name\_t

The type of a mempool.

##### void name\_init(name\_t m)

Initialize the mempool 'm'.

##### void name\_clear(name\_t m)

Clear the mempool 'm'.
All allocated objects associated to the this mempool that weren't explicitly freed
will be deleted too (without calling their clear method).

##### type *name\_alloc(name\_t m)

Create a new object of type 'type' and return a new pointer to the uninitialized object.

##### void name\_free(name\_t m, type *p)

Free the object 'p' created by the call to name\_alloc.
The clear method of the type is not called.



### M-SERIAL-JSON

This header is for defining an instance  of the serial interface
supporting import (and export) of a container
from (to) to a file in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format.
It uses the generic serialization ability of M\*LIB for this purpose,
providing a specialization of the serialization for JSON over FILE*.

Another way of seeing it is that you define your data structure 
using M\*LIB containers (building it using basic types, strings,
tuples, variants, array, dictionaries, ...) and then you
can import / export your data structure for free in JSON format.

If the JSON file cannot be translated into the data structure, a failure
error is reported (M\_SERIAL\_FAIL). For example, if some new fields are present
in the JSON file but not in the data structure.
On contrary, if some fields are missing (or in a different order) in the JSON
file, the parsing will still succeed (object fields are unmodified
except for new sub-objects, for which default value are used).

It is fully working with C11 compilers only.

##### void m\_serial\_json\_write\_init(m\_serial\_write\_t serial, FILE *f)

Initialize the 'serial' object to be able to output in JSON format to the file 'f'.
The file 'f' has to remained open in 'wt' mode while the 'serial' is not cleared
otherwise the behavior of the object is undefined.

##### void m\_serial\_json\_write\_clear(m\_serial\_write\_t serial)

Clear the serialization object 'serial'.

##### void m_serial_json_read_init(m_serial_read_t serial, FILE *f)

Initialize the 'serial' object to be able to parse in JSON format from the file 'f'.
The file 'f' has to remained open in 'rt' mode while the 'serial' is not cleared
otherwise the behavior of the object is undefined.

##### void m_serial_json_read_clear(m_serial_read_t serial)

Clear the serialization object 'serial'.

Example:

        // Define a structure of two fields.
        TUPLE_DEF2(my,
                   (value, int),
                   (name, string_t)
                   )
        #define M_OPL_my_t() TUPLE_OPLIST(my, M_DEFAULT_OPLIST, STRING_OPLIST )
        
        // Output in JSON file the structure my_t
        void output(my_t el1)
        {
          m_serial_write_t out;
          m_serial_return_code_t ret;
        
          FILE *f = fopen ("data.json", "wt");
          if (!f) abort();
          m_serial_json_write_init(out, f);
          ret = my2_out_serial(out, el1);
          assert (ret == M_SERIAL_OK_DONE);
          m_serial_json_write_clear(out);
          fclose(f);
        }
        
        // Get from JSON file the structure my_t
        void input(my_t el1)
        {
          m_serial_read_t  in;
          m_serial_return_code_t ret;
        
          f = fopen ("data.json", "rt");
          if (!f) abort();
          m_serial_json_read_init(in, f);
          ret = my2_in_serial(el2, in);
          assert (ret == M_SERIAL_OK_DONE);
          m_serial_json_read_clear(in);
          fclose(f);
        }
        

### M-SERIAL-BIN

This header is for defining an instance of the serial interface
supporting import (and export) of a container
from (to) to a file in an ad-hoc binary format.
This format only supports the current system and cannot be used to communicate 
across multiple systems (endianess, size of types are typically not abstracted
by this format).

It uses the generic serialization ability of M\*LIB for this purpose,
providing a specialization of the serialization for JSON over FILE*.

It is fully working with C11 compilers only.

##### void m\_serial\_bin\_write\_init(m\_serial\_write\_t serial, FILE *f)

Initialize the 'serial' object to be able to output in BIN format to the file 'f'.
The file 'f' has to remained open in 'wb' mode while the 'serial' is not cleared
otherwise the behavior of the object is undefined.

##### void m\_serial\_bin\_write\_clear(m\_serial\_write\_t serial)

Clear the serialization object 'serial'.

##### void m_serial_bin_read_init(m_serial_read_t serial, FILE *f)

Initialize the 'serial' object to be able to parse in BIN format from the file 'f'.
The file 'f' has to remained open in 'rb' mode while the 'serial' is not cleared
otherwise the behavior of the object is undefined.

##### void m_serial_bin_read_clear(m_serial_read_t serial)

Clear the serialization object 'serial'.
